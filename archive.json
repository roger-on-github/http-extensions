This document doesn't define any such checks, though clients\n>  could be configured with a policy that defines what is acceptable.\n\nis very unclear for a server implementer (as well as clients).  If authentication doesn't succeed, should the client fail-back to clear-text (the origin) or hard fail?\n\nOne possibility (which may start getting outside of the editorial realm) is for an Alt-Svc parameter indicating that authentication will not be present (either via an unauthenticated cipher suite or a mismatching cert).  This would allow clients to chose to ignore the Alt-Svc rather than following it and erroring or needing to fall-back).  For example:\n\n```\n Alt-Svc: h2=\":443\" ; unauth\n```\n",

      "body": "The current Alt-Svc-Used indicator is a boolean (\"0\"/\"1\"), due to the desire to preserve privacy.\nBased on some explorations of how this would be implemented on the server side, we realized that this doesn't provide enough information to distinguish between the different use-cases for Alt-Svc.  In particular, a server would have no way to know if just the protocol was changed, or if both the protocol and host were changed.  If we start using multiple Alt-Svc sources (such as DNS) this also becomes relevant.\n\nAn option short of including (proto,host,port) in Alt-Svc-Used would be to include a better indicator of how the Alt-Svc was used.  This could be either a bitmask or a string of tokens.  For example, with a bitmask:\n- 1 = Alt-Svc was used to change protocol  (ie, service proto != default origin scheme's proto)\n- 2 = Alt-Svc was used to change port     (ie, service port != origin port)\n- 4 = Alt-Svc was used to change host    (ie, service host != origin host)\n- 8 = Alt-Svc was obtained via Alt-Svc header\n- 16 = Alt-Svc was obtained via ALTSVC frame\n- 32 = Alt-Svc was obtained via DNS record  (reserved, not yet defined)\n\nWith a token approach, short character strings could replace the bitmask.\nIn either case this would result in a value like:\n\n  Alt-Svc-Used: 20\n  Alt-Svc-Used: h,f\n\nFor load-balancing, this would make it possible to infer the (proto,host,port) that may have been used in cases where it differs by use-case but is consistent within a use-case.\n\nThis would also significantly help with debuggability on the server side.\n### Editorial\n\nRegardless of how this is resolved, there is still text referring to previous Alt-Svc-Used indicator proposals that should be cleaned up to be consistent with whatever we decide on.  For example, with the current text the following is confusing and should be removed:\n\n>   To reduce the ability of servers to track individual clients over time (see <xref\n>   target=\"tracking\"/>), an alternative service indication sent by a client &SHOULD-NOT; include\n>   any alternative service information other than the protocol, host and port.\n\n(as the protocol, host, and port aren't part of what is being sent in the current indication).\n\nThe same applies of the \"Tracking Clients Using Alternative Services\" section which may be a remnant from previous versions.\n\nThe current text also mentions a \"token\" in the Alt-Svc-Used definition, but does not explain it or specify how it might be used or set.\n",

Otherwise trying to guess which combinations of parameters will cause an AltSvc to be ignored becomes impossibly unwieldy.   If \"manditory to understand before using a service\" parameters are necessary, Martin has the good suggestion of adding a parameter that lists those extension parameters where not understanding them should cause a client to ignore a service.  For example a parameter:\n      must=\"manditory1,manditory2\"\nsuch that:\n    Alt-Svc: h2=\":443\"; ma=60; manditory1=1; manditory2=\"foo\"; optional1=\"bar\"; must=\"manditory1,manditory2\"\n\nWould cause the service to be ignored if the client didn't understand manditory1 or manditory2, but optional1 would be ignored if not understood.\n",

When the protocol does not explicitly carry the scheme (e.g., as is usually the case for HTTP/1.1 over TLS), servers can mitigate this risk by either assuming that all requests have an insecure context, or by refraining from advertising alternative services for insecure schemes (such as HTTP).\n",

My original example of User-Agent matching is one: https://github.com/mnot/I-D/issues/21#issue-15143707. \n2. I can imagine Cookie use-cases with very similar semantics, where you can have multiple different values that you'd want to resolve to the same cache entry?\n\nPerhaps (1) can be addressed by looking at \"Mobi\" and other substrings.. there are edge cases here across all the various shipped browsers, but maybe that's OK. For (2), arguably the site controls the cookie so they can establish a stable key and use that.\n\nFor existing Client-Hints what we have already is probably enough: you'd use partition against `Width` hint to account for the DPR+resource width variants; or partition against `DPR` or `Viewport-Width`. When combined with Save-Data match you'd then double the number of buckets... there is no way to indicate that some buckets should be combined, but maybe that's ok?

However, it would help avoid a complete combinetric cache explosion.\n\nI'm torn as to whether this is a good idea; Ilya could be right that in complex situations, we'll just fiddle request header semantics and/or synthesise new headers with ServiceWorker (although it'd be a great pity to use SW just for that, I think). \n\nWDYT?\n",

However, we _could_ put it in the parameter values themselves.\n\nE.g., right now, if you did:\n\n> Key: user-agent;substr=android;substr=mobi\n\nYou'll end up with four \"buckets\":\n1. UA contains both `android` and `mobi`\n2. UA contains `android` but not `mobi`\n3. UA contains `mobi` but not `android`\n4. UA contains neither `android` nor `mobi`\n\n... and it would behave the same way if you did:\n\n> Key: user-agent;substr=android, user-agent;substr=mobi\n\nSo, I think that gives you the behaviour you want. \n\nWe _could_ add syntax to `match` and `substr` to avoid creating all of the permutations of buckets, e.g.,\n\n> Key: user-agent;substr=\"android&mobi\"\n\nSo you'd end up with just:\n1.

It's still better than `Vary:User-Agent`, though. (With the added benefit that it (hopefully) makes server operators think a bit more about what resources they send to whom, and why, and how they're cached.)\n",

That leads either to accepting that this is a doomed effort, or embracing the fact that this has some limitations.  I think that the latter is the only approach where we get something better than what we have today.\n\nAs @mnot notes, the current scheme does allow someone to do a full search.  The only concern being that you have less reuse in cases where the same response covers multiple points in the space.  If you test for \"ipad\", \"android\" and \"mobi\", then you have an 8 point space, with many of those point receiving the same content.  The only disappointing part is that the cache can't reuse from different buckets.\n\nI think that the example @igrigorik described is a great one to look at.  If Chrome on the Nexus 7 and Safari on iPad were willing to change UA strings to include a clear piece of generic identification (like \"tablet\", just sayin'), then the situation improves because fewer buckets are needed to target content to particular devices (or classes of device).\n",

Instead of hijacking `&` inside of the value, would it make sense to define an operator that creates a composite key for all the sub-buckets? e.g. `Key: user-agent;substr=a;substr=b;xyz` where xyz is a token that indicates that all the buckets should resolve to same key? Although, I guess that reduces the whole space to an _and_...? Ugh.\n\n_p.s. to be honest, I guess I didn't read the spec close enough, because my interpretation of substr was that substr=a;substr=b would result in same key if `a | b`._\n",

      "body": "The spec currently says that if a server sends `Accept-CH: DPR`, then the `DPR` header should be added \"to all subsequent requests\".\n\nHowever it is (as far as I can tell) completely undefined what a \"subsequent request\" is. Does it affect only future requests to the server which sent the `Accept-CH` header? If the header is sent with the response during a document load, does it affect all requests coming from that document, no matter which server the request goes to?\n\nGenerally speaking, if a CDN which servers images has to send a `Accept-CH: DPR` header before it will receive any `DPR` headers, that means that the first image will have to be served without DPR information. This seems unfortunate since ideally the first image that a page loads is the most important image.\n\nA better solution is that when a browser loads a \"document\" and receives a `Accept-CH` header in the response, that header would affect all the requests that are made from that document, no matter which server the request is going to. If desired, in the future we could add more complex syntax to `Accept-CH` which enables opting in to certain CH headers only for certain servers and/or only for certain resource types.\n\nWe could also add a header which enables a server to opt in to getting specific CH headers for all future requests to that same server. To for example allow an image server to opt in to certain headers even if the document-serving server has not yet adopted the `Accept-CH` header. But I'm not sure how popular such a solution would be given first-load the problem mentioned above.\n",

This needs to be more precisely defined in order to not cause interoperability problems between browsers.\n\nI know that there's a tension between not sending too much header data which is commonly not used by servers, thus wasting bandwidth, while also sending enough information that servers can optimize their responses. However leaving the decision out of the spec and up to clients, doesn't make the problem simpler, it just pushes it onto someone else.\n\nWhat I propose is the following:\nFor \"document\" loads, i.e. when browsers make the request during navigation, send the information which is typically needed for websites to determine what markup to serve. So things that let the server choose which version of a responsive-design page to serve first. I'd think this includes things like \"viewport-width\", \"downlink\" and \"save-data\". (We might also want to send other information like, is the device touch-enabled, but that's a separate discussion I think).\n\nFor non-\"document\" loads, serve no CH headers by default and instead let the \"document\" response opt in to which headers should be served for the non-\"document\" requests within that document. See also issue #155.\n",

The policy is null if no policy has been set.\n  - _note: we'll have to define how to parse and set it as part of CH draft, I guess._\n- In Fetch... \"A request has an associated client hints policy\".\n- In Fetch, as part of [HTTP-network-or-cache fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-http-network-or-cache-fetch):\n  - If the request is a [navigation request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#navigation-request), send:\n    - `Downlink`, if known\n    - `Save-Data`, if enabled\n    - `DPR`\n    - `Viewport-Width`\n  - Otherwise, send client hints headers set by the client hints policy.\n\nWDYT?

However, it's debatable how cookies like `foo;` should be treated: as the cookie without value or without key.

Given Firefox's experience with <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1551729> and related bugs above, this seems like it might be baked into some user-visible sites that are unlikely to update.

I think Firefox's behavior is most correct here as a logical consequence of the spec change to fix 0004, and I believe Chromium will match it once the bug filed for 0020 above is addressed.\r\n\r\n* [0027](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/cookies/http-state/resources/test-files/0027-test) sends `Set-Cookie: foo` and `Set-Cookie: bar`.

However, given the prevalence of Facebook tracking I'm really surprised these sorts of cookies are only seen by 0.12% of users so thought I'd comment to note this in case those estimates are not accurate? Perhaps the stats are not picking up these cases?\r\n\r\nI've seen this on many sites and only picked the Guardian as a well-known example and guessed first time it would be on there (news sites are good ones to pick when looking for tracking pixel examples!). https://www.wsj.com/ sets the same if you prefer something US based and https://www.theaustralian.com.au/ sets the same (but not on the main domain) for those of you in that side of the world.",

That feels like an important part of an eventual \"Intent to Ship\", rather than a discussion of what we'd like the spec to say. If we decide to accept the suggestions above, then I'm pretty confident that we can work out how and when to ship it (especially given that there's no real agreement among browsers today, so the status quo is already trifurcated as per https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/159#issuecomment-569233866 above).\r\n\r\n> The number of 0-byte Cookie headers is only a lower bound on how many no-name-no-value cookies are in use.\r\n\r\nIndeed!

The 0.0025% is the number of requests (not page views, FWIW) for which we'd shift from sending an empty `Cookie` header to sending no header at all.

It sounds like a bug to me, and not something that I think should stop us from making a decision here on the underlying question of whether an empty cookie is a thing we should support.\r\n\r\nThanks for sending on @mikewest . I more meant it as a concern that the 0.12% of users figure sounds way too low to me given Facebooks prevalence. Note you don\u2019t need to be a Facebook user or visit a Facebook site to get this cookie - just a site that uses Facebook advertising pixels (of which there are many!). So I still have that concern that this figure sounds way too low to me. Which then begs the question as to whether there are more cases than we think there are?\r\n\r\nNow I agree that particular example sounds like a bug and I doubt this empty cookie is being used and so don\u2019t think blocking it off will cause a breakage, but still, I\u2019m uneasy that the stats seem wrong and that we are using this (potentially incorrect) stat to justify the low chance of breakage with this change. There might be other cookies on other sites that will cause breakage. To be clear, I don\u2019t actually think it will cause a lot of breakage, but would rather than was based on a stat we are comfortable to stand behind than one that we have potential concerns with.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to double check that 0.12% stat given this example?\r\n\r\nMaybe a lot less users than I think are getting this cookie but given I\u2019ve spotted it on 3 major news paper sites in 3 distinct countries, without having to look too far for these examples, makes me suspect that is not the case. [Other analysis](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/third-parties#fig-3) says Facebook assets are being used on 2.38% of the most used 5.7 million sites and I\u2019d guess they all come with some cookies for free. And that stat treats each of those 5.7 million sites equally when actual usage will be heavily skewed to the sites at the top end than the tail so usage will likely be more than that as top end sites are more likely to use Facebook advertising in my opinion. And again, I\u2019m not concerned with this Facebook example - but more that it seems to suggest the 0.12% stat feels wrong.\r\n\r\nOr maybe it\u2019s not being included since this empty cookie doesn\u2019t seem to be sent in follow up requests, and that\u2019s what that stat is measuring? If that\u2019s the reason, and we\u2019re comfortable with that explanation and the risks that entails (I am for what it\u2019s worth), then that\u2019s fine, but thought it worth asking the question.",

I noted above that I'm less concerned about this case than I am about the \"We used to get a `Cookie` header, but now we don't get anything at all!\" case, but I'm honestly not terribly concerned about either given the existing diversity in the way browsers handle `Set-Cookie: =`.",

The presence of the resource indicates support for cross-port Alt-Svc without strong authentication.  The presence of a commit member, however, indicates that only strongly-authenticated alternatives should be used (effectively, opting out of the weaker mode).\n\nHowever, since the commitment to strong auth has an explicitly stated lifetime, while the consent to cross-port doesn't, it's possible for the end result to be that a client believes the server has consented to weak cross-port alternatives after the commitment has expired.\n\nSeveral reasonable solutions exist:\n- Move the duration out to an explicit \"lifetime\" member which details the time for which the entire structure can be treated as valid; \"commit\" would effectively become a flag.\n- HTTP caching semantics might be used for the same purpose; \"commit\" still becomes a flag\n- Explicitly state a desired mode of behavior (strong-auth only, same-host only, same-host or strong auth, etc.) and optionally a lifetime.  This is harder to extend in the future, but may be the clearest today.\n",

The problem here is that the well-known resource is easy to block, which allows an attacker to force a client back to cleartext.  The point of creating the commitment is to make that attack impossible.\n\nThe freshness lifetime option is hazardous because it means that you potentially won't get queries for new copies on shorter timescales, though I guess you could require revalidation or something like that.\n\nA single `lifetime` member at the top level or a lifetime for every alternative is better, I think.  You then don't have to reach down into caching details to make your decisions.  The only risk there is that - outside of any commitment - it creates a situation where the alternative is valid on paper (the lifetime hasn't expired), but it isn't available, but I guess that's no different to advertising an alternative that doesn't exist.\n\nSo, in the interests of a less brittle solution:\n\n``` js\n{ \"http://example.com\": { \"tls-ports\": [443], \"tls-commit\": true, \"lifetime\": 1000 } }\n```\n",

However, once a valid and authenticated commitment has been\nreceived, clients SHOULD NOT use an unauthenticated alternative\nservice.  Where there is an active commitment, clients SHOULD ignore\nadvertisements for unsecured alternative services.

A third-party inserting CSS media queries within an HTML page to fingerprint a specific user is a lot more difficult (and public) than simply recording the numbers received in an HTTP request header field. In any case, \"no worse than other peoples' problems\" is not something we put in HTTP specs, because these specs usually outlive other problems.\n\nThe section should say that sending the CH header field can increase the passive fingerprint of a browser request if the field values are not limited to values common across a range of users. For example, sending the exact viewport-width and downlink bandwidth can easily identify a specific user across multiple unrelated sites, whereas sending DPR is less likely to identify a specific user because such ratios tend to be common to many users. Restricting field values to an enumerated range, where the user agent picks an enumerated value that is close enough to its current state, might lessen the risk of fingerprinting. Likewise, a user agent might reduce such risk by only sending the field on same-site subrequests, in requests for which identifying information is already being sent in the form of authentication or persistent cookies, or in requests to sites that have been previously whitelisted.\n\nI think that would be sufficient. We just need to explain the risk.\n",

          "body": "> When generating CACHE_DIGEST, a client MUST NOT include cached responses whose URLs do not share origins [RFC6454] with the request of the stream that the frame is sent upon.\n\nI'm curious, is there an explanation somewhere why this design was chosen? There seems to be a trade-off between _coverage_ (maximizing the amount of useful URLs in the digest) and _privacy_ (minimizing the privacy leakages relative to HTTP/2 as it stands currently). As @bryancall points out, the current proposal has suboptimal coverage. To illustrate, here are two alternate strategies:\n\n_Include all URLs for which the server is authoritative_: This is suggested by @bryancall. I believe this strategy maximizes coverage: a server can push any URL for which it is authoritative, and this strategy includes all such URLs in the digest. However, there is an increased chance for privacy leakage. Say a server is authoritative on a.com and b.com, and some user makes requests for a.com. If the cache digest includes URLs from b.com, the server can learn of those URLs even if the client never makes any requests for b.com.\n\n_Tie the digest to cookies_: This idea is inspired by @kazuho's [H2O](https://h2o.examp1e.net/configure/http2_directives.html#http2-casper), which puts the cache digest in cookies. We can't actually store the digest in cookies (it's too inefficient), but if we designed the digest in such a way that it _could_ be stored in cookies, at least in theory, then we could argue that cache digests do not increase the chance for privacy leakage relative to current H2. For example, suppose a URL can be included in a cache digest only if the following conditions hold:\n- The server is authoritative for that URL.\n- The client is making a request for origin https:x.y.foo.com, the URL's origin is X, and the client has a cookie that could be sent with requests for https:x.y.foo.com _and_ with requests for X.\n\nI believe this is roughly equivalent to the current proposal if the client does not have any domain-level cookies. However, if the client has a cookie for \".example.com\" and the client makes a request for \"www.example.com\", the cache digest can include URLs from \"cdn.example.com\". Note that example 3 from @bryancall's initial comment would not work: on a request for \"finance.yahoo.com\", the digest would not include URLs from \"s.yimg.com\", although if the server is authoritative for both domains, the client may later make requests for \"s.yimg.com\", at which point the cache digest could be updated to include URLs on that origin as well.\n\n> CACHE_DIGEST allows such cache-based fingerprinting to become passive, since it allows the server to discover the state of the client's cache without any visible change in server behaviour. As a result, clients MUST mitigate for this threat when the user attempts to remove identifiers (e.g., \"clearing cookies\").  This could be achieved in a number of ways; for example: by clearing the cache, ...\n\nExpanding on the above design, we could view the cache digest as an internally-maintained cookie. When the browser makes a request to origin X, the browser creates a cookie with the domain set to host(X). If X is https, the cookie is Secure, otherwise it is HttpOnly. From this point forward, each time the browser caches a URL from origin X, it adds that URL to X's cache digest cookie. If a URL is evicted from the cache, it is removed from the cache digest cookie. If a page from origin X sets a cookie on domain(X), then cache cookies for all hosts Y where domain(Y) = domain(X) are linked, as it may be possible to send union(cookie(X),cookie(Y)) when an H2 connection is opened to either host. Note that the cache cookies for X and Y are linked _but not merged_ as the external server may not be authoritative for both hosts -- this needs to be checked for each H2 connection.\n\nExcept for being created automatically, and being sent in CACHE_DIGEST rather than Cookie, cache digest cookies behave exactly like other cookies. They are cleared when the user asks for cookies to be cleared. They are disabled when the user disables cookies. They are cleared when the browser is closed if the browser was opened in Incognito mode.\n\nThere may be concerns about the following case. Suppose all hosts under `.aws.com` are served by the same cloud frontend, which terminates the H2 connection, but each host on this domain is served by a separate backend server. Now suppose `evil.aws.com` sets a cookie for `.aws.com`. Can `evil.aws.com` can spy on a user's from `alice.aws.com`? The answer is yes if the client sends a single cache digest that covers both hosts. I see two ways to prevent this:\n1. Although a client may proactively send multiple cache digests, following the above rules, each digest summarizes URLs for a single origin only. (The cloud frontend would be trusted to not forward the digest for `alice.aws.com` to `evil.aws.com` -- this doesn't seem like a problem, since the frontend is already trusted to partition their traffic.) This may use extra bytes by requiring separate-origin digests to be sent in separate CACHE_DIGEST frames.\n2. Cache digests from multiple origins can be merged, but the client will merge digests for `evil.aws.com` and `alice.aws.com` only if _both_ origins have set a domain cookie for `.aws.com`. This potentially saves bytes by allowing one cache digest to cover the entire connection.\n\nWDYT?\n\n> When generating CACHE_DIGEST ... with the request of the stream that the frame is sent upon.\n\nRelatedly, I'm a bit confused with the last part of that sentence. I would expect CACHE_DIGEST to apply to the entire connection (StreamID = 0x0) rather than an individual stream. Why not send CACHE_DIGESTS on stream 0x0 and include an explicit scope (authority) in the CACHE_DIGEST frame? This costs a few extra bytes but will (a) eliminate a race between receiving the first request and the digest, and (b) make it more obvious _which_ authority the digest applies to.\n",

For example, a server could send the following cookie with every response:\n\n``` plain\nName:    (URL, Validator)\nValue:   \"1\"\nPath:    \"/\"\nDomain:  hostip(URL)                 // but see below\nExpires: never                       // but see below\nSecure:  true if scheme(URL)=\"https\" // always true when H2 is https only\n```\n\nThe RFC could say that the client should automatically create the above cookie for every response it receives from an origin. This cookie is treated exactly like every other cookie except that: (1) it is created automatically, (2) it expires when the response is evicted from cache, (3) it is sent in a cache digest, rather than the Cookie header field, (4) it is an internal cookie not available via the normal APIs (such as JS), (5) it does not count towards browser cookie limits, and (6) the Domain field is an exact-match (as in same-origin checking) rather than a suffix match as for normal cookies.\n\nThis exposition makes it obvious exactly where the privacy concerns are -- there are privacy concerns whenever cache digest cookies are treated differently than normal cookies. I don't think any of the above six differences are significant from a privacy perspective. (The only difference that might be significant is (5), but we could argue that a server could work around these limits in various ways, e.g., by using JS code to merge multiple cookies into a digest.) Some of the differences, like (6), are actually _stronger_ from a privacy perspective.\n\nThis exposition also makes it obvious where implementations might accidentally introduce privacy concerns. For example, if a browser is configured to reject third-party cookies, then it should _also_ reject third-party cache digest cookies, such as when an image from `foo.com` is used on a page from `bar.com`. Another example: if a browser partitions \"incognito mode\" cookies into a separate cookie store, it should do the same for cache digest cookies.\n\nLastly, my second (more controversial) suggestion is that the above exposition provides a path towards solving some of the problems raised by @bryancall. Namely, if `www.foo.com` has already stated willingness to share cookies with `foo.com`, then it _may_ be reasonable for `www.foo.com` to share cache digest cookies with `foo.com`. Though, on second thought, it's probably more reasonable to have an explicit signaling mechanism, rather than an implicit signaling mechanism. A Cache-Control extension may do the trick, as suggested in [this thread](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2016JulSep/0520.html).\n",

The only differences between a Service Worker-based implementation and the HTTP/2 frame-based implementation is that the frame-based implementation is more efficient (in HTTP/2 frame-based approach, the digest needs to be sent only once per connection, whereas for Service Worker-based or cookie-based implementation, a client needs to send a digest per every request), and that the digest more accurately reflects the state of the cache (Service Worker cache is located in front of the web browser cache, so a digest of Service Worker cache does not reflect what exists in the browser's cache).",

I was making a writing suggestion: if you can write the RFC in such a way that it's obvious that the proposed cache digest frame is equivalent to cookies, then you can more easily argue that you're not introducing any privacy concerns. [1] My specific suggestion is for the browser to create a \"cookie\" each time it caches a response, where that cookie is treated like any other cookie with a few small changes (see the list of six items in my prior comment).\r\n\r\nRephrasing the explanation in terms of cookies also makes it obvious where privacy holes may arise. For example, if a browser supports \"normal\" and \"incognito\" modes that use different cookie jars but the same cache, the browser needs to attach the \"cache cookies\" to the appropriate cookie jar rather than to the cache, otherwise there may be information leakage across browser modes.\r\n\r\nDoes that sound reasonable? Contrast this to [Section 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cache-digest-01#section-4), which is currently kind of hand-wavy. One example: Section 4 tries to address the incognito problem by saying \"User Agents SHOULD NOT send CACHE_DIGEST when in 'privacy mode'\", but that doesn't solve the problem, since there can still be leakage from incognito mode to normal mode when both modes share a cache. This sort of problem becomes more obvious when you express digests in terms of cookies.\r\n\r\nI realize cookies are kind of weird because they don't exactly follow the same-origin policy. Maybe a better analogy would be local storage?\r\n\r\n[1] Even if you rephrase the explanation in terms of cookies, privacy concerns are still likely to arise since the cookies are created automatically by the browser rather than manually by the server, but that is a separate issue.",

To date, using path provided sufficient scoping to avoid cross-application conflicts.\n\nEven if the second cookie was allowed to be set in the scenario above, it would not have resulted in a fixation vulnerability because one path was not a path-match of the other.  It might be possible to fine-tune the algorithm to only block non-secure cookies if and only if a secure cookie already exists that is a [path-match](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.1.4) of the insecure cookie.

There are other ways that these types of attacks can be mitigated without breaking backwards compatibility, and cover more attack scenarios, at the expense of being opt-in by the server.  These might include the __Secure- prefix (assuming no one is using this in the wild), or introducing a new cookie header, like Cookie-Attributes, that servers could inspect to determine whether or not to trust a cookie.\n",

It would prevent a session fixation attack via a maliciously injected cookie on `us.battle.net` with a path of `/login/en/`, for instance, which seems like a valuable thing to maintain.\n\nFor clarity, I think we're talking about changing the text in [section 3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cookie-alone-00#section-3) to something like:\n\n> 1.  Before step 11, execute the following step:\n>    1.

Their \"domain\" domain-matches the \"domain\" of the newly\n>            created cookie, or vice-versa.\n>       4.  The \"path\" of the newly created cookie path-matches the \"path\"\n>            of the existing cookie.\n\nChanging 4 to include \"or vice-versa\" might also be reasonable; it would allow the initial example of two distinct cookies in two distinct root-level paths, but would disallow cookies with the same name but different `secure` settings inside a path (e.g. `/`, `/login/`, and `/login/en/`). That is, I think it is desirable to break backwards compatibility with the final example you provide.\n\n> Both the draft as written, and the path-match variant proposed above suffer from fixation attacks when an HTTP resource is visited first.\n\nIndeed.

This was explicit in the discussion of [Origin Cookies](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-origin-cookies-01), and implicit in the general tone of discussion around cookie changes in general. @mnot might have a different opinion as chair of the group, but my feeling is that anything more complicated that the current proposal is unlikely to garner much support.\n",

Because they're delivered securely, so we ~know that the `Set-Cookie` header reflects the site's intent, and not the intent of a MitM.\n2.  To prevent sites from downgrading `secure` cookies, we'd also have to prevent them from deleting `secure` cookies. That doesn't seem like something we should do, for the same reason that we wouldn't prevent a site from removing data from `localStorage`, et al.\n\n> Such an attempt might actually just be a site bug.\n\nI don't think site bugs are the threat we're concerned about.

Copying the second example in my first comment:\n1. https://example.com/ sets a Secure cookie named SESSIONID with the path /.\n2. http://example.com/foo/ sets a non-secure cookie named SESSIONID with the path /foo/, which will be ignored.\n\nYes the RFC would plug the cookie fixation hole quickly, but it effectively forces servers that write cookies to the current path to do one of two things: 1) never serve HTTP content on a path that is a descendant of an HTTPS resource, or 2) coordinate cookie naming conventions between potentially unrelated resources (and maybe unrelated development teams).  If I had to deal with that scenario, I'd probably just focus more on HSTS instead to avoid those cookie related headaches.\n\nMike, you [said yourself ](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-set-origin-wide-policies-via-a-manifest/1617/4) that you feel like path-level distinctions in cookies was a historical mistake, so wouldn't opt-in mechanisms (HSTS, Cookie-Attributes, [Suborigins](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-suborigins/), etc) be better long-term than allowing the cookie path-match algorithm to further dictate how servers organize content?\n\nI'll send the Cookie-Attribute header proposal to the mailing list (ietf-http-wg at w3.org, right?)\n",

When we can create opt-in mechanisms that allow sites to lock themselves down further than we can lock down the platform at large, we should.\n\nHowever, relying strictly upon those mechanisms is unlikely to produce actual change in the ecosystem. For instance, despite fairly broad outreach and understanding, something like ~4% of the cookies Chrome users set in the last month have the `Secure` attribute. ~7% have `HttpOnly`. I think it's pretty clear that, in an ideal world, those numbers would be an order of magnitude higher.\n\nIt seems unlikely than an opt-in approach would buy us much in terms of protection, especially when the opt-in is fairly complicated, as `Cookie-Attributes` would be.\n",

However, while [sketches are being pushed around](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2016JulSep/thread.html#msg292), it's not clear if and when such a format will come either\u2026 In the meantime, I believe we can shape JFV (with minor modifications) into a format that is immediately useful and addresses many of the current pain points for **new** header fields. Specifically: \n- UA's want a reusable and tested parser. Today we end up hand-rolling parsers for most every field (due to ABNF quirks, past implementation mistakes, etc), which leads to interop problems, security issues, and so on. Also, this is not a Chrome specific problem, all major UA's have the same pain points, and we all need to do better.\n- At the same time, all UA's have well-tested JSON parsers. Reusing existing code helps cut down on attack surface area, helps with interop, etc. As such, JFV format is a strong plus.\n- JSON parsers are easy to come by on the server side and all the same benefits and motivation is just as applicable.\n\nThat said, as others have already pointed out, we do need additional restrictions on JFV beyond what is currently in the spec. Also, it just so happens that browsers already follow the [ECMA-262 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html), which addresses most of the  raised concerns:\n- Specify how to deal with repeated fields:\n  - [InternalizeJSONProperty(holder, \n    name)](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-internalizejsonproperty): \n    _\"In the case where there are duplicate name Strings within an object, \n    lexically preceding values for the same key shall be overwritten.\"_ All \n    browsers already do this.\n- Specify number encoding format\n  - [4.3.20 Number \n    value](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-terms-and-definitions-number-value): \n    Number value is primitive value corresponding to a double-precision 64-bit \n    binary format IEEE 754-2008 value.\n  - [11.8.3 Numeric \n    Literals](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-literals-numeric-literals)\n- Specify date encoding format\n  - [20.3.1.16 Date Time String \n    Format](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-date-time-string-format), \n    [Date.parse()](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-date.parse)\n    - We can require ISO 8601 Extended format.\n- Specify character encoding\n  - UTF-8 [[RFC3629](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629)]\n\nAre there other issues that were brought up that are not addressed above? \n\nMy proposal is that we update JFV to spec above ECMA-262 restrictions and requirements. Doing so would enable UA's to adopt JFV with minimal work.\n\n_p.s. in progress specs and browser features that plan on leveraging JFV: [Clear-Site-Data](https://www.w3.org/TR/clear-site-data/), [Feature Policy](http://wicg.github.io/feature-policy/), [Reporting](http://w3c.github.io/reporting/), [Network Error Logging](http://w3c.github.io/network-error-logging/), \u2026 and I'm sure we'll see more soon._\n\n/cc @reschke @mnot @mcmanus \n",

I think I disagree that opt-ins \"tackle the root of the problem\". They give developers who pay attention the ability to mitigate the effects of problems. That seems fundamentally different than making the platform sane in the first place. For instance, X years after introduction, ~52% of cookies are set over secure transport, but only 6% of cookies use the `secure` attribute (with all the same measurement caveats as above). I'd suggest that that attribute is rather heavily documented as a best-practice that folks should use unless they have a good reason not to.\n\nIf solving timing attacks is actually important, then it seems like we're going to have to do significantly better than `secure` did to have any meaningful effect with an opt-in. Is that likely?\n\nWe can't be aggressive enough about `SameSite` to make it opt-out without actually breaking the internet. I'm not sure that's the case with the various events and resource timing APIs we expose.\n\nI should probably be typing this on the other bug.\n",

This document updates that definition and describes how it should (and should not) be used.\n- Change the first paragraph of Introduction to:\n\n> By default, header field values in HTTP messages ([RFC7230]) cannot directly carry characters outside the US-ASCII coded character set ([RFC0020]). RFC 2231 ([RFC2231]) defines an encoding mechanism for use in MIME headers. This specification documents a subset of that encoding that has been used in some HTTP header fields. Its use in new header fields, or new parameters on existing header fields, is NOT RECOMMENDED.\n- Remove section 4 contents (and subsections), replace with:\n\n> The convention defined by this specification allows a parameter fields that have two possible encodings (ASCII without the `*`, UTF-8 with it). This causes considerable complication in the use and implementation of those parameters, since they now have to handle both, and all of the possible permutations and edge conditions implied by this (e.g., how a header field value with both ought to be handled).\n> Furthermore, this encoding can only be used in parameter values, not in other parts of header field values.\n> As a result, use of this encoding is only RECOMMENDED where already defined; new header fields, as well as new parameters on existing header fields, SHOULD NOT use it when non-ASCII content is anticipated. Instead, they SHOULD mandate a character encoding of UTF-8, combined with escaping of non-ASCII characters using a well-defined convention (e.g., percent encoding, as per [RFC3986).\n- Optionally, move the existing contents of section 4 into an appendix, but clarify that they're there merely for the benefit of existing uses.\n",

It is known to be fairly fast, and is used as a basis by many hash table implementations (thanks to its resistance to collision).\n\nI am not sure how collisions can be used to attack Cache Digests, but it might still be a good idea to have resistance considering the fact that an attacker can insert a digest (by controlling the victim's browser to access a specific resource on the target's website (by using IMG links, etc.).\n",

If the resource is ordinarily pushed alongside a parent document AND neither the parent document nor the secret resource are cacheable you have a way to exploit things AND the 404 page on the site IS cacheable then you have a situation that can be exploited.\n\nThe attacker includes the parent document in an iframe and measures the time to load the document when the secret is pushed.  The attacker then iteratively tests different URIs by forcing a load of a non-existent, but potentially colliding resource then reloading the iframe.  A collision will be apparent when the iframe load takes significantly longer (one round trip).  At that point, the attacker need only generate hash pre-images (since none of the fast hashes claims to have pre-image resistance, this isn't that difficult given sufficient constraints on the shape of the secret) until it finds the secret.\n\nThis has a false positive rate that would have to be corrected by a more rigorous test on potential candidates, but it seems like it could be feasible given enough time.  Everyone give thanks to @w3c/hr-time for making this possible!\n\nSimilarly, if the pushed resource is cached, then the attacker might find a way for the server to server and conditionally push it resources with a URI component that is attacker controlled.  That would enable a faster attack too.\n\nThis attack might be used to recover whose twitter feed someone has viewed.  Even though user images are bucketed in size to resist traffic analysis, this sort of attack relies on a different side channel that I doubt has been properly safeguarded.\n\nThis is rendered less effective by choosing a hash with pre-image resistance.  It's still relatively easy to engineer a collision (particularly since cache digests are necessarily very narrow), but the hash can't be reversed to find the URL.  It could still be used as a confirmation step.  While the space of potential twitter image URLs is obscenely large, the set accounts that are interesting to an attacker might be easily enumerable (if not all accounts if it comes to certain resourceful attackers).\n",

The notion of alt-svc has always been that it is a shortcut route (or dns name if your prefer) for the same content as supplied at the default origin. If for any reason you cannot get there, you can always go back to the default origin. All of the machinery around this (validating alternates, etc) can happen transparently and asynchronously in the background until they are ready to be used. A mechanism that requires a characteristic of a route (auth'd TLS) but not the route itself doesn't play well - its far too easy to brick your site for an extended period of time and really ceases to be opportunistic in any meaningful sense. If you're up to managing this, then you're probably up to the fight of running https:// and using HSTS which at least has the benefit of not bringing a whole second technology (alt-svc) into play.\n\n[there is further discussion on list]\n",

          "body": "@igrigorik Yes, definitely.\n\nThe reason for this request is that recently, there has been a huge market increase in Displays that are non-sRGB (In particular DCI-P3 and AdobeRGB displays).\n\nAs an example: iPhone 7, Galaxy S7, MacBook Pro, Surface Studio, all of them support DCI-P3 wide color.\n\nHowever since the **color-gamut** it\u2019s a display thing the only way to detect for `wide-color` support from server side would be `Client Hints` since its not even possible with `UA-sniffing`.\n\nThe motivation behind is, we are building an image optimisation service for Automating Resource Selection, based on DPR, supported file format, and display wide color support, among other variables.\n\nFor example, [Apple is recommending now](http://devstreaming.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2016/712ugi7vg8jznn3pc3u/712/712_working_with_wide_color.pdf) to create 2 separate assets for Normal and Wide Color images, as in Retina vs. Non-Retina images.\n\n> The best solution is to serve a wide-gamut image when the user is on a wide-gamut display, and an `sRGB` image when the user is not on a `wide-gamut` display. This is just another case of responsive images, and is exactly what the element and media queries were designed to handle.\n\nThis is also why [Safari has added `color-gamut` media query](https://webkit.org/blog/6682/improving-color-on-the-web/) to `CSS Color Level 4`.\n\nSo the reason of making this as a `Request Header` is exactly the same logic to `DPR`: \nWe should send this info between Browser and Server, so the developer doesn't have to do it by hand, solving the problem more elegantly.\n\n### Current Problem\n\n``` html\n<picture>\n  <source media=\"(color-gamut: p3)\" srcset=\"photo-wide.jpg\">\n  <img src=\"photo-srgb.jpg\">\n</picture>\n```\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\n``` html\n<picture>\n  <img src=\"photo.jpg\">\n</picture>\n```\n\n**Browser Request Header**\n\n``` yml\nColor-Gamut: p3\n```\n\n**Server response**\n\n``` yml\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Color-Gamut: p3\n```\n\n**Result: Server returns a `8 bit sRGB` or `16 bit Display wide-color` image in a responsive way**\n\nThe core use case behind `Color-Gamut` hint is to enable automatic resource selection for image assets based on display type. This will enable delivery of optimal image variant without any changes in markup.\n",

We can expect something alike to the Retina/Non-Retina race rush. \r\n\r\n> Color-Gamut + Content-Color-Gamut: I think this makes sense.\r\n\r\nYes, this would cover 95% of use cases, and spec-wise it should be simple enough. \r\n\r\nSo, even for simple cases, this CH spec addition is close to a `MUST` for responsive color optimisation. Why? Because `wide-gamut` is one of things those things that cannot even be guessed by *User Agent*: there is no info about the display on the string. So this spec is gonna be the only way to advertise to the server in an automated way.\r\n\r\n> @color-profile.. I'm still trying to grok. From what I can tell right now, it accepts a URL to a profile, plus a rendering intent. Do we have some concrete examples of how we expect developers to use this?\r\nYes, I agree the use cases for `color-profile` are few, thus I don't see this one as `MUST`, however a `nice to have` one.\r\n\r\nThe use cases I see for this are minor but:\r\n1) To override a photo ICC profile (ie. it was wrong in the first place)\r\n2) To specify a ICC profile for a photo that had ICC stripped - or didn't had one in the first place (ie. it was removed by some \"optimisation\" tool like [jpegoptim](http://www.kokkonen.net/tjko/src/man/jpegoptim.txt) or [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/color-profiles.html))\r\n\r\nSo yeah I can guess mostly photographer / design websites would make use of this one.\r\nNote that, at least [CSS Level 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#at-ruledef-profile), doesn't need to include the URL for the profile since its predefined in two cases: `DCI-P3` and `Rec.2020`.\r\n\r\n> Does this prevent us from publishing a new \"replacement\" draft? How do we advance these things forward?\r\n\r\nI don't know about this *WG particular timing interests*,\r\nhowever having `Color-Gamut + Content-Color-Gamut` in the spec as soon as possible would give Browser vendors enough time and pave the way to implement it smoothly. \r\nBe either an addition to CH or a different spec. For **consistency** it does makes sense to be a part of the CH spec though, just like `DPR`.\r\n\r\nI can understand well why some don't see the *urge for it*: \r\nyou need to have a `wide-color` hardware first to *see* the need, \r\nbut we can be sure that almost **any smartphone or computer display that you get in 2017 is gonna be a `wide-color` one**.",

Sending 8bit/channel P3 to sRGB has poor effects and will result in banding and clamping therefore we want to reduce to 8bit/channel, color correcting to sRGB.\r\n* Balance experience and performance: A server wants to reduce bytes by stripping icc metadata. BUT doing this today has inconsistent experiences with different browsers. Notably, browsers that incorrectly assume the attached display is also sRGB and don't color correct (Chrome/FF). The very presence of this CH is a legacy v. modern color-correcting indicator. (this is assuming that [667431](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=667431) ships ahead of CH)\r\n",

Are there any downsides to that?\n\nIt is true that you could use URL+ETag as a key of fresh digests (though server implementations might become slightly complicated).\n\nHowever, it is still desirable to be able to distinguish whether if a resource is freshly cached or stale-cached, since the server behavior needs to be different for the two. For freshly cached resources, there is no need to push anything. For stale-cached resources, the server needs to push 304.\n\nIf the client sends a single digest covering both freshly and stale-cached resources, then the server would need to either push nothing for both of them (which means that client would issue conditional requests for stale-cached responses that it need to use), or push 304 for both of them (which means that the server would send 304 for even the freshly cached resources).\n\nNote also that we haven't agreed on whether if sending a digest of stale responses is worth the extra bandwidth, or how we should push 304.\n\nLast time I looked into my Firefox's cache, the number of cached objects were as follows:\n\n| domain | total objects | fresh objects |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *.facebook.com | 2273 | 790 |\n| *.google.com | 1003 | 373 |\n\nAs you can see, fresh objects consists about 1/3 of the total objects cached for a domain. Sending a digest for all objects would roughly triple the size of the digest from when we just send the digest for freshly-cached objects.\n\nConsidering the fact that assets critical to the rendering path are more likely to be marked as fresh, it would make sense to just send the digest for freshly cached objects.\n",

However, for the browser use-case, we would not want to send a digest covering tens of thousands of responses (since it would not fit into a single TCP packet or two). And from the table in my comment above, it is likely that a digest would not be that big.\n\nSo I think N would not be very large that it would have impact on performance. Converting a pre-calculated SHA256 into a GCS entry is a lightweight operation: truncate, emit one or two '0's followed by '1' (corresponds to the quotient), and then the remainder bits.\n",

During expansion, you iterate through the contained objects by dereferencing them to build a new hash table.\n\nHowever, in a Cuckoo Filter, there is no such reference. Therefore, to (re)build a Cuckoo Filter, you would need to use some pre-existing structure in the browser cache to iterate through the objects belonging to a specific origin. However, under premise that there is no per-origin index (note: we are considering the use of Cookie Filters since we do not want to introduce such index), we would need to iterate through the entire cache.\n\nCan we afford such an operation (e.g. iterating through the entire cache) running periodically?\n",

However, under premise that there is no per-origin index (note: we are considering the use of Cookie Filters since we do not want to introduce such index), we would need to iterate through the entire cache.\n\nThat would indeed be a serious handicap to the Cuckoo filter approach.\nFortunately, browsers can extend the basic Cuckoo filter implementation to also store the full crypto hashes or other references to the stored objects on top of storing fingerprints.\n\nThis extra info won't be sent up as part of the Cuckoo filter, but can be used locally to extend it in O(N) complexity.\n\nSuch references to the actual stored objects can also allow periodic (potentially out-of-band) O(N) calculation to create a stale resources filter that would make it easier to push 304s.\n",

Similar language is in the parsing algorithm for parameterised labels. \r\n\r\nIf that remains, it would be good to reinforce this in requirements (rather than just leaving it in the algorithms) for Dictionaries; Parameterised Labels already does that.\r\n\r\n**If** Alt-Svc were defined as a structured header, I think QUIC's use case could be shoe-horned in; e.g.,\r\n\r\n    Alt-Svc: hq=\":49288\";quic=\"1,51303334\"\r\n\r\nThat's not pretty, of course, but I question how common this particular scenario is (most headers that need to be ordered can just use a list).\r\n\r\nFor @jyasskin's use case, something similar can happen (whitespace is a natural choice for delimiting URLs); e.g.,\r\n\r\n    Signature: sig2;\r\n      sig=*MEQCIGjZRqTRf9iKNkGFyzRMTFgwf/BrY2ZNIP/dykhUV0aYAiBTXg+8wujoT4n/W+cNgb7pGqQvIUGYZ8u8HZJ5YH26Qg;\r\n      validityUrl=\"https://example.com/resource.validity https://fallback.example.net/foo\";\r\n      certUrl=\"https://example.com/certs https://and.another.example.org/bar\";\r\n      certSha256=*kQAA8u33cZRTy7RHMO4+dv57baZL48SYA2PqmYvPPbg;\r\n      date=1511301183; expires=1511905983\r\n\r\nIf we allowed multiple instances of Dictionary (and Parameterised Label) keys, I'm concerned that it would be significantly more difficult to map structured headers into common data structures, and therefore would increase the friction against the introduction of generic parsing and serialisation tools for them -- as well as complicate their use. Remembering that the goal for SH is **not** to be able to express every conceivable header, but to get the 80% of \"cream\", I think this is a good tradeoff.\r\n\r\n",

(That said, it might be that this could be a SHOULD, or a requirement that explicitly describes the situations where it doesn't need to be followed.)\r\n\r\nWhile the current language provides flexibility to the client implementation, I think there are interoperability reasons to specify conditions that support user privacy here. Providing the expectation in the spec that the server receives Client Hints only if it has asked for them means that developers won't have to check UA implementations individually to try to figure out how to receive hints and UA implementers will have a common required condition which will benefit all users' privacy in providing for more detectability.",

This means that if the origins are interested in receiving hints on all requests, then they need to include the Accept-CH header on all responses. This has two disadvantages: (i) Browsers currently fail to include the hints on the first request after the browser restart; and, (ii) It may not be possible for the origin servers to include the Accept-CH header on all responses due to responses being served out of different endpoints (CDNs etc.).\r\n\r\nTo fix this: The Accept-CH header should also support a [max-age](http://wicg.github.io/reporting/#max-age-member) header value which indicates for how long should the browser remember this opt-in (including across browser restarts). A value of max-age set to 0 should cause the browser to stop sending client-hints to the origin. As an example,\r\n\r\n`Accept-CH: feature1, feature2, max-age=86400`\r\n\r\nwould imply that the browser should include hints `feature1` and `feature2` for next 86400 seconds for that origin.",

E.g. HSTS headers are ignored without a validated certificate. We could limit the possible lifespan of any time-bound directive to the remaining TTL of the certificate. Say my LE certificate expires in 30 days; the user  agent could store the CH settings for exactly this time span. Usually certificates are renewed before the expire. This should allow user agents to revalidate and reschedule the property expiry well before they expire. The same could apply to HSTS or other properties. A user agent may use this site/origin property until the certificate expires, and it must be revalidated at the next contact thereafter.\r\n\r\nThe spatial scope of the certificate is somewhat boring, because it usually covers a whole origin in sense of `/` on a certain domain name. However, wildcard certificates or ones with more than one common name could be used to tie together a bunch of hostnames. We could use that as an outer bound for origin properties.\r\n\r\nMore generally, could we transfer properties such as [Origin Policies](https://wicg.github.io/origin-policy/) or HSTS directives as part of the TLS handshake in an [ALPN](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7301)-like fashion? This would enable the server to communicate transfer rules to the user agent before the first request on HTTP level is carried out.",

Alternatively, a client can treat advertised support as a persistent origin preference and append same header fields on all future requests initiated to and by the resources associated with that origin.\r\n\r\n\"All future requests\" is a long time indeed. While of course the client isn't going to literally do that (eventually it'll be garbage collected, or the user will reset state, or the machine will be recycled), from a server-side perspective, it'd be nice to have *some* level of control over how bloated your requests get.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, having `Accept-CH` possibly indicate that future references *to* **and** *from* this origin seems like a pretty broad brush to be painting with. While Chrome might make some reasonable decisions about tradeoffs here (and probably needs some wiggle room), if this ever does get implemented elsewhere, this broadness and freedom is a recipe for bad interop and worse server-side headaches.\r\n\r\nSo, can we nail this down at all? \r\n\r\nThe most conservative approach is:\r\n\r\n\"Send CH headers on subrequests generated by this content, please.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the above also says \"subsequent requests initiated to the same server\" in the primary spot; the case above is relegated to \"optionally.\"\r\n\r\nPersonally, my preference would be to drop \"subsequent requests initiated to the same server and, optionally\" and the corresponding text in the example below it. The primary use case for CH as I understand it is serving appropriate subresources, NOT dynamically modifying HTML, so that should do the trick.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something, @igrigorik?\r\n\r\nRegardless of that, \"server\" is used very loosely above; I think you mean \"origin\", right?

In practice, many of the most critical decisions about page format are made when the HTML is generated -- e.g. whether you should serve \"light\" version of the page, picking resource density, ..., and feature-detecting support for CH to begin with. In short, we do need to allow hints on navigation responses.\r\n\r\n> \"Send CH headers on subrequests generated by this content, please.\"\r\n\r\nI think that's a reasonable definition for `Accept-CH`, iff we also combine it with `Accept-CH-Lifetime` proposed in https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/306 to cover the case for initial navigation. Concretely, the proposal here would be: \r\n\r\n- Scope down `Accept-CH` to \"subsequent requests generated by this content\"\r\n- Define `Accept-CH-Lifetime` to allow opt-in to be remembered for specified period of time. \r\n  - When this is present, opt-in applies for all content that belongs to the origin.",

This also can specify lifetime by having an \"expires\" or \"maxAge\" property in the parameter dictionary for the call.  \r\n\r\nThe TPWG has discussed using cookies as a more generic method, but the SOP gets in the way (you cannot limit the state to a top level context).\r\n\r\nThe Accept-CH header is similarly determining stateful site-specific behaviour for subresources, perhaps this points to a generalised solution? Especially as there are privacy/user control issues in common?\r\n\r\nI am thinking about a well-known cookie prefix (as proposed for RFC6265bis) that would cause the cookie to be sent to subresources in the cookie header, but only within the context of the parent that placed it. The existence of particular forms of this well-known cookie could then determine UA behaviour (such as sending Client Hints to subresources).\r\n\r\nImplementation would be simpler because the expiry procedures are already in place.\r\n\r\nA further advantage would then be that the state is automatically contained in the UAs cookie store, accessible to existing privacy oriented UA UIs and extensions, increasing transparency.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nSet-Cookie: __SRAccept-CH=DPR;expires=Sat, 05 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT",

The TLS certificate MUST stil be used to do so, as described in [RFC7540] Section 9.1.1.\r\n\r\nAs @MikeBishop pointed out during discussion in Chicago, this is the first draft that explicitly removes DNS from the loop as a factor, rather than just delegating DNS.  I did not get the sense that strong consensus exists yet for removing DNS as a factor without an additional authenticator.\r\n\r\nParticular concerns (some of which are highlighted in the Security Considerations) include:\r\n\r\n* When a cert (or validation behavior) is compromised, currently active MitM or DNS poisoning is required to exploit.  This new behavior enables vulnerabilities here to be exploited by simply getting a client to follow a link to a malicious server that can expand the ORIGIN set to cover the origins it wants to hijack (and which are covered by the compromised cert or compromised validation behavior).\r\n* This has the change has potential to significantly change the operational behavior of clients.  Rather than clients always following DNS, clients may now aggregate origins onto a connection to a server that was never handed out in the DNS for that name.  This may have unintended consequences, such as allowing a non-production server sharing a cert with a production name to accidentally hijack production traffic; or otherwise giving a server operator with a cert covering a name the power to pull in client traffic for that name without this being explicitly configured through the DNS.\r\n\r\nThis change (to not follow the DNS) also becomes much more powerful (and more useful and more potentially perilous) when combined with any future pushed certificate functionality.  I'm not convinced that the having to follow the DNS name is \"onerous\" enough to justify the security impact.\r\n\r\nSome options appear to be:\r\n\r\n1) Remove this \"Clients MUST NOT consult DNS\" clause.  This doesn't prohibit the expansion of ORIGIN sets, but does mean that existing DNS service discovery and DNS following behavior must still be followed.  This change could be introduced in a subsequent draft that much more explicitly worked through the security considerations and mitigations.\r\n2) Leave the language as-is, possibly expand on security considerations, and do a more detailed security analysis (especially for how this might interact with future pushed server certs).\r\n3) Specify additional mitigations that should replace consulting DNS, such as a pushed DNSSEC record chain terminating in the server IP, signed Alt-Service records, or similar.  Most of these would require subsequent drafts to define in-detail, along with a corresponding security analysis.\r\n\r\n(Regardless, we may wish to clarify the subsequent bullet to make it clear that clients MAY consult the DNS to determine whether an existing connection can be reused or whether a new connection should be established.  While the existing \"MUST NOT consult DNS\" phrasing does not prohibit this, it is misleading on a first reading.)\r\n",

The origins being added are explicitly nominated by the server; presence in the certificate is not enough to cause the connection to be used (indeed, that concern was a large part of the motivation of this draft).\r\n\r\nI believe that limiting origin-set and connection reuse was the original motivation for this draft, however, it seems that possible use cases changed a bit because of [draft-bishop-httpbis-http2-additional-certs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-bishop-httpbis-http2-additional-certs), which together with this draft, makes it possible to expand the origin-set and effectively hijack traffic for all domains that server has valid SSL certificates for.\r\n\r\nEven ignoring the compromised server scenario, there are at least a few operational issues with bypassing DNS:\r\n\r\n1. Many medium to large companies use multiple CDN providers and steer traffic using DNS. They use either custom GeoDNS solutions or services like [Cedexis](https://www.cedexis.com/solutions/multi-cdn/) to load balance traffic across multiple CDNs, or simply use one of the CDNs as the primary and rest as active backups. All those CDNs have valid SSL certificates, so neither CT nor certificate pinning would help.\r\nSimilarly, some websites migrate traffic to DDoS protection services only during attacks, but those services are configured and have valid SSL certificates at all times.\r\n**Basically, configured != active.**\r\n\r\n2. Servers with wildcard certificates can takeover all traffic for the domain, even if some subdomains would never be routed to a particular server. To give an extreme example, let's say that `www.bank.com`, `promotions.bank.com`, etc. are served by the CDN, but `secure.bank.com` is handled by the bank's own infrastructure. There is nothing stopping the CDN with valid certificate for `*.bank.com` from hijacking the traffic for `secure.bank.com`, and while certificate pinning would prevent traffic for `secure.bank.com` from reaching the CDN, it would effectively result in DoS and pretty bad end-user experience.\r\n\r\nOne solution that came up in discussions with @grittygrease and @enygren, was to include signed DNSSEC response in the `ORIGIN` frame, to prove that the traffic should be routed to this particular server. This obviously solves only part of the problem, since it doesn't mean that traffic from _this particular client_ would be routed to that server, but it's much better than servers going completely wild.",

Otherwise this draft changes the operational model of the web much more substantially than people may realize at first glance.

This might be due to geographical distribution of nodes, contractual arrangements (the CDN is charging more than their competitor today, so they're on backup duty), or any other operational concern.\r\n\r\nThe problem with all of these is that there is no way to communicate this intent to the client that doesn't ultimately chain back to the certificate.  A certificate that the server instance has.  Relying on the DNS is a fig leaf.  As @PiotrSikora says, even DNSSEC fails because you can't be sure that this is the RRset that would be sent to *this* particular client.\r\n\r\nIt looks like what you are looking for is a better means of control over your server instances.  The reliance on DNS is a poor substitute for a genuine signal.\r\n\r\nCrazy suggestion, would a certificate extension that enabled this functionality make you happier?  As long as the CDN never received a certificate with the extension, it couldn't make these sorts of assertions.  I'm not saying that I think that's a good idea, but I want to explore the boundaries of your problem better.",

This also has potentially weird interactions with DANE as it specifies that the SNI should be the terminal CNAME or SRV record target.\r\n\r\n* For Port, there is a weird interaction with Alt-Svc.  In particular, the server's port may be different than the port of Origin.  For example, an Alt-Svc for https://www.example.com to alt.example.com:8443 still has the origin of https://www.example.com:443 but given the current wording would have the incorrect initial origins set of https://www.example.com:8443\r\n\r\nWould it be better to have the implicit initial Origin Set from a client's perspective (when an ORIGIN frame is first received) be \"the origin (as per [RFC6454]) that resulted in the successful establishment of the connection\" ?   \r\n\r\nThis is ambiguous from the servers' perspective but perhaps much cleaner and simpler from the client's perspective.\r\n\r\nAnother ambiguity: if a 421 is received for the last origin in the Origin Set, does it become empty or return to uninitialized?  (Should we clarify the former, and that clients may wish to soon close out the connection if no new origin additions are received soon?)\r\n",

I\nknow in my codebase that would be a significant problem - the coalescing\nrules are all centralized but not all dispatch is about coalescing.\n\nImagine a case where you're connected to the default host for the origin\nand receive an empty ORIGIN frame (and we change the rule to be default is\nthe null set).

For shared hosts, this can cause severe privacy issues by exposing which other domains/hosts are served by the same server.\r\n- Origin IP exposure: unless explicitly filtered out, any reverse-proxied connection can expose the origin server's IP to a connecting client, due to the previous point's type of exposure. \r\ne.g. `example.com` is proxied, `example2.com` is not proxied. Connecting to `example.com` connects to the proxy, exposes `example2.com` also being hosted in the `ORIGIN` frame. Looking up `example2.com` in DNS then exposes the origin IP of `example.com`.",

The server just speculatively pushes and figures it out based upon the responses (i.e. no change)\r\n2. We create an explicit signal from the client to the server (e.g., \"I will process ORIGIN\", probably a SETTING, or \"I have processed ORIGIN\", probably a frame)\r\n3.

If it has no clear idea, it should probably refrain from ORIGIN?\r\n\r\nIf I understood correctly, the question boils down to: \"Can the server, having send out ORIGIN, still PUSH resources from domains that are not in ORIGIN?\"\r\n\r\nAnd my answer would be no. I would like to use ORIGIN to hint to the client that on any other domain, it can expect a 421 as answer. The reason for that lies in separate TLS options for hosts that share a certificate. If those differ, the server should not server _or push_ resources from the other domain. It could require a client cert, or only stronger ciphers.\r\n",

Expect-CT is checked at connection setup time, completely divorced from any context from which we can construct an `Origin` header.\r\n\r\nTherefore I think we need to resort to using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for reports, if we want Expect-CT to be reasonably implementable in a web browser without violating the SOP.\r\n\r\n@scotthelme @mikewest @eranmes",

      "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nMy name is Luis. I'd like to discuss with you a proposal to solve the following use case:\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only mechanism to share your location with a website is through the JS Geolocation API. This has some limitations: First, in order to have the server know the client\u2019s location there are two full roundtrips required (one roundtrip to load the page with Javascript code, and a second roundtrip to actually send the location to the server and get back a location-aware response). While not as significant as the first limitation, the second limitation is that the client must execute Javascript in order to acquire location.\r\n\r\nFor example, for services like Search, it means that the very first response from a server will contain non-localized results, and a second roundtrip would be required to refresh those results (assuming Geolocation permission is already granted for the origin).\r\n\r\nThere's many ways to solve this problem through headers, so no JS would be required and clients could proactively include geolocation data in the very first request (after the server asked for it in previous sessions, and permissions are granted).\r\n\r\n[Here you can find a document detailing the problem and a possible proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zL4qyOpp6W36H4_eMpmth3Yj_ZTMZ3wCupc01q5qatA/edit)\r\n\r\nAfter discussing with @igrigorik he suggested that Client Hints might be a potential way to implement this too, which makes perfect sense. However, some features in the original proposal would not be possible with current CH draft (parameters for CH-Accept or path restrictions for when the data should be included).\r\n\r\nIt would be great to get your opinion on this and whether this is something that might be interesting for people in this working group.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nLuis.",

The best way to make a proposal for new work to the WG is to send e-mail; we generally use this repo to talk about things we've already decided to do.\r\n\r\nClient Hints is already very advanced in the process, so we're not likely to add it to that spec. However, it doesn't have to be in that document to be considered a \"client hint\" (which is really just a use of content negotiation). \r\n\r\nI'd encourage you to bring this up on the WG mailing list:\r\n  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/\r\n(you can just paste the text above into an e-mail)\r\n\r\nBe aware that, because it's Geolocation, there's going to be extra scrutiny from a privacy/security perspective.

          "body": "@mnot I suggested to @luisbargu that we should start a thread here first to hash out a few high-level questions about the existing proposal and possible CH integration, before we take it to the wider list. I'll re-open this, but if you feel that this belongs on the list, we can take it there.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFirst off, I think CH is a great conceptual fit to what @luisbargu is proposing, and I'd _really_ love to see us reusing established CH mechanism to ease implementation, both on the UA/client side and for developers \u2014 this makes everyone's life easier. I'll leave the \"what\" discussion, like granularity and type of data delivered via this hint, for a separate discussion, and focus on the how here...\r\n\r\n>Header sent from the server to the user agent when a host is compatible with the Geolocation\r\n> Header and is requesting geolocation to be attached in subsequent requests.\r\n>\r\n>>Geolocation-Request: Path=\"/localService\"; Type=IfAlreadyGranted; Expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2017 12:00:00 UTC\r\n\r\nThe CH mechanism for the above is:\r\n\r\n> Accept-CH: Geolocation\r\n> Accept-CH-Lifetime: 86400 (seconds)\r\n\r\nThere are two bits missing: Path and Type. \r\n\r\n### Path\r\nThis is something we considered for CH in the past \u2014 \"I want to scope my hints to a subpath\" \u2014 but punted on due to limited (or so we deemed at the time, at least) utility vs implementation complexity tradeoff (equivalent to cookie paths, which is a burden we didn't want to take on). In the last few years of CH experiments, I've not heard any complaints or requests for this. I think that was the right call, and I'd suggest we stick with it.\r\n\r\n### Type\r\nfwiw, I'd like to make an argument that we should omit this. The idea here is to enable sites to trigger a permission prompt via a header, which seems convenient on the surface, but experience shows that this is a bad UX pattern: you [should be using JS API to trigger permission prompt after explaining the intent](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WNPIS_2F0eyDm5SS2E6LZ_75tk6XtBSnR1xNjWJ_DPE/edit) and motivation. The incremental value we're adding with the header trigger is low, and seems more like a footgun. \r\n\r\nIf you buy both of the above, then CH has all the necessary building blocks to enable Geolocation. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@luisbargu WDYT? How critical, or not, are Path and Type for the use case you had in mind?\r\n\r\n@yoavweiss curious to hear your thoughts on the above, and Geolocation use case for CDNs.\r\n\r\n@mnot tactical question: what's the right process for followup RFC's to \"register\" hints to be compatible with Accept-CH? Do we need any extra steps in CH for a registry, or some extension hooks?",

So if you went through this for CH and considered path was not worth, it probably applies well to this case.\r\n\r\nRegarding Type to trigger prompts... Right, it's doable through JS but was nice to offer a purely http based solution. Also understand the tradeoff in this case for value vs complexity, and agree it's also not core to the geolocation header.\r\n\r\nSo on my side, if others think CH is the right approach for this, then for consistency and simplicity I'd be happy to follow that path and start a draft, on top of CH.

      "body": "Based on https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/QHI3sio6--Q/v_zWX1O6AAAJ I have a couple of questions about the impact of `Accept-CH-Lifetime` as currently defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints-04#section-2.2.2\r\n\r\nThe main risk, touched upon in the [Security Considerations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints-04#section-5) section, is the fact that providers of cross-origin subresources (e.g. images) loaded from pages with `Accept-CH` headers will start receiving fingerprinting-prone information about the configuration of a connecting client. Note that it will expose more information than what was available to these parties in the past because subresources such as images cannot use client-side logic to access information sent in Client Hints. A related issue is that based on the sets of headers sent in such subresource requests, the subresource owner might be able to identify the referring site even if it sets a Referrer Policy to prevent disclosing its URL or origin. For example, requests from a large site which sets `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer; Accept-CH: DPR` will be distinguishable from requests from sites with `Accept-CH: DPR, Viewport-Width` and from those without client hints. Depending on the chosen set of hints this can in practice uniquely identify the origin visited by the user.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of `Accept-CH-Lifetime` will extend this problem to all resources on a given origin -- if one page sets the header, then subresource requests from all pages in that origin will start carrying hint information. This can be undesirable for the user because it can disclose information about the visited origin and broadcasts fingerprintable information to all parties from which the given origin loads subresources.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this should be mitigated, possibly by one of the following:\r\n- (Preferably) Not broadcasting client hints on cross-origin subresource loads.\r\n- Obeying Referrer Policy and omitting hints if the referring page attempts to restrict data which is sent in the `Referer` header. Similarly, hints should probably also be stripped on HTTPS -> HTTP transitions.",

In general, it would be great if the current _non-lifetime_ Accept-CH behavior was also limited to same-origin subresources -- I don't think requiring developers who want to use client hints to also leak this information to owners of third-party subresources loaded on their pages is particularly great.\r\n\r\n> The Chromium implementation (currently underway) processes Accept-CH-Lifetime header from only HTTPS origins.\r\n\r\nWhat about HTTPS pages which have HTTP subresources?

          "body": "@arturjanc thanks for the great feedback. Let me try to unpack...\r\n\r\nPrior to introduction of `Accept-CH-Lifetime` (ACL) \u2014 which is very recent \u2014 there was no mechanism in place for an origin to persist a preference for hints across independent requests. As a result, navigation requests did not get any hints and only subrequests of the \"opted-in document\" were eligible. The extra complication here is that the initial set of core use cases (image optimization) frequently relies on use of CDN's and third-party services+origins, which means that prior to ACL there was no way for those origins to enable CH hints, since page origin != resource origin. As a result, the decision was to extend Accept-CH opt-in to all resources fetched by the page.\r\n\r\nNow that we have ACL, it may be possible to revisit this setup. In particular, if we scope ACL to per-origin, then both the page origin and resource origin can advertise support separately and these preferences will be persisted across requests. In fact, I suspect that this is what will happen anyway, because for cases like image serving CDNs will advertise support for hints on their own origins, such that any site relying on their service can benefit by default.\r\n\r\n@yoavweiss wdyt?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> What about HTTPS pages which have HTTP subresources? The behavior I currently see for Accept-CH is that the HTTP subresource requests have client hints (but no Referer);\r\n> ...\r\n> Obeying Referrer Policy and omitting hints if the referring page attempts to restrict data which is sent in the Referer header. Similarly, hints should probably also be stripped on HTTPS -> HTTP transitions.\r\n\r\nI think this would naturally fall out of the origin-scoped model? As in, if opt-in is scoped to HTTPS then we wouldn't send hints to HTTP, unless the HTTP origin also explicitly opted-in. \r\n\r\nRe, Referer:  \"I have third party resources on my site, which may have hints enabled, and I want to strip those alongside referrers\", is that the use case? If so, that seems legitimate, but using Referer does feel a little action-at-a-distance to me. As in, I wouldn't expect Referrer to control hints? That said, I don't have a better suggestion either. @mikewest wdyt?\r\n\r\n> A related issue is that based on the sets of headers sent in such subresource requests, the subresource owner might be able to identify the referring site even if it sets a Referrer Policy to prevent disclosing its URL or origin.

In particular, if we scope ACL to per-origin, then both the page origin and resource origin can advertise support separately and these preferences will be persisted across requests.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a better model than the status quo because it limits the sending of hints to origins which opt into receiving them. However, it still has the issue of revealing new information to providers of third-party subresources which they can't obtain now. This seems fine to do with opt-in from the first party (which can already get the Viewport-Width, etc via client-side scripts and then provide it to the CDN in the URL), but seems less great if the CDN can decide to always get hints in all requests, because of the passive fingerprinting potential.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of double-keying the hints on both the first- and third-party? That is, if you set `Accept-CH(-Lifetime)`:\r\n- Requests for same-origin subresources will carry client hints (up until the max-age if you specify the lifetime).\r\n- Requests for non-same-origin subresources will not carry client hints if the other origin doesn't set `Accept-CH-Lifetime`.\r\n- If you load third-party resources from an origin which sets `Accept-CH-Lifetime`, requests from your origin to the third party will carry client hints.\r\n- Requests from other origins (which don't set `Accept-CH`) to the third party will not carry hints.\r\n\r\nI realize this reduces the \"on by default\" benefit you mentioned, but it seems like a relatively simple opt-in for the first party (which is already a necessary condition in `Accept-CH`) and it mitigates the risk of enabling passive tracking of users based on client hints, which I assume will evolve to expose more interesting data. As you mentioned above, this would also make the Referrer discussion moot (and I agree that controlling client hints via Referrer Policy seems awkward).",

Also, as a side effect, double-keying would expose first vs repeat visit bit?\r\n\r\nI'm not ruling it out, but it's not clear to me that it would be a big win in this context?",

Essentially, if you have a first party which wants to use client hints they can opt into them and then their non-same-origin subresources can gets hints if their providers also set ACL (which is fine because the first party could manually pass the hints in the URLs anyway). This prevents CDNs and other origins from which subresources are loaded from getting hints during the user's visit to non-cooperating sites, but should still offer the benefits you're looking for in cases where both parties opt in.\r\n\r\nI commented on https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/pull/373 -- it looks good to me in general, modulo the broader double-keying issue (which I believe is important).",

It may be the case that some particular hints make sense to be scoped to first-party only, but that's a discussion we should have in the context of individual hints; as a general mechanism, CH must support delivery of hints to all origins, possibly with knobs for 1P origin to control which 3P origins are allowed to receive hints. \r\n\r\n**Current proposal for `Accept-CH-Lifetime` is to allow hint preferences to be registered by any origin.** The limitation, as pointed out in discussion above, is that it doesn't provide any distinction between 1P or 3P opt-in. To that end, we discussed a few options:\r\n\r\n1. We can add double-keying to scope 3P registrations to within 1P origin \u2014 i.e. 3P registration on foo.com does not propagate to same 3P origin on bar.com.\r\n1. We can further restrict 3P ability to register for hints by requiring that 1P opts in for receiving CH hints \u2014 i.e. what @arturjanc proposed above.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I think (1) is the right behavior, from a user perspective. However, what it doesn't address is the 1P -> 3P delegation case where 1P origin may want to control if (and which) 3P is allowed to request CH. @arturjanc's proposal (b) is an attempt at this, but a fairly blunt one: 3P is allowed to receive hints if 1P opt's in, but this is a blanket policy for all 3P origins and it similarly doesn't provide any fine grained control for which hints are allowed to be requested. If we all agree that the \"1P -> 3P hint delegation\" use case is an important one, I think we need to explore mechanisms beyond (b). \r\n\r\nTo that end, squinting at this space, I see close parallels to Feature Policy: we have features (hints) that we want to selectively enable/disable, and we may want to scope them to a list of origins \u2014 e.g. enable them for \"self\" / 1P only, selectively enable them for some set of origins, or disable them outright. And so, here's my crazy proposal of the day: \r\n\r\n1. ACL registrations should be double keyed -- see (1).\r\n1. Control over which hints are enabled, plus delegation, should (?) be addressed via Feature Policy. \r\n\r\n```\r\nFeature-Policy: {\r\n   \"ch-dpr\": [\"self\"],  // DPR hint is 1P only\r\n   \"ch-ex1\": [\"self\", \"foo.com\", \"bar.com\"],  // ex1 hint is 1P + select 3P\r\n   \"ch-ex2\": [] // ex2 hint is disabled for everyone\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other benefit here is that this opens a well-defined way to think about a \"default FP policy\" for each hint. For example, some hints may be restricted by the UA to be 1P only, other may be on-by-default for everyone (e.g. save-data), and others may be off by default.\r\n\r\nWDYT? Crazy talk? :)\r\n\r\n/cc @clelland @rbyers",

As it stands today, the answer is \"yes\", and CH does not define a mechanism to control this.\r\n\r\nI do think this is a valid use case, but I don't think we should be solving it within CH directly. Rather, we should be reusing client specific infrastructure to address this.. e.g. in a context of a browser that's [Feature Policy](https://wicg.github.io/feature-policy/), which provides a mechanism to selective enable/disable features and defines relevant delegation mechanisms \u2014 e.g. policy based, frame-level control, cascading logic, etc.\r\n\r\nSo, my proposal here is:\r\n - @arturjanc I believe we addressed your original concerns via #373. \r\n    - We can resolve this thread\r\n    - Publish new 05 draft with updates in #373\r\n - Pursue delegation discussions in context of Feature Policy.\r\n\r\n@arturjanc @mnot does that sound reasonable?",

On the other hand, a UA may choose to define a \"default off\" FP policy for CH for 3P origins and that's totally fine: that's an implementation decision of the UA, and different UAs may even chose different policies for different hints, instead of applying a blanket policy for all CH hints - e.g. Chrome communicates Save-Data hint to all origins today if data saver feature is enabled.\r\n\r\nAs such, I think we can add some language in CH to explain and allow for above implementation options, but I don't think we can dictate a default FP policy in this spec. \r\n\r\nSpec language bits aside, and with respect to UA implementation: I think we should have a more detailed conversation, on a hint-by-hint basis, to determine default on/off policies, and I'd suggest that we move that discussion to FP forum. \r\n\r\nDoes that sound reasonable to you guys?",

I hear your concern, but I'm not convinced that the real risk is any more significant than what is already exposed by most sites to 3P's through active content (or CSS even).\r\n\r\nI'd set aside the case of fully active content and focus on 3p resources that do not allow the hosting party to get information that would be exposed in hints (i.e. loading content such as images, fonts, audio/video, or even JS/CSS pinned to a specific version via Subresource Integrity). If a website loads such resources -- which is very common -- and it enables hints, *and* the 3p separately also enables hints, it has two consequences:\r\n\r\n- The user will start sending hint information to the third party, which may allow the 3p to correlate requests from that user across different 1p sites which use hints, even if third-party cookies are disabled. The hints will also be sent automatically, rather than require active probing, which will result in potentially fingerprintable information being sent out to third parties which either couldn't obtain it, or which likely wouldn't resort to actively detecting it and sending it out.\r\n- The user will start sending hint information which might tell the 3p which website/page the user is on, even if the website uses Referrer Policy to remove the Referer header (e.g. in the case where the 3p knows their resource is being loaded by 10 other sites, and only 1 of them enables the set of hints they see in the request).\r\n\r\nThis behavior is arguably worse privacy-wise than the status quo for users of sites which enable hints. I like being able to control 3p hints via FP, but developers won't understand why they might want to do it (partly because the third-parties they load data from might not enable hints until later, so the developer would not see them in 3p requests while testing on their sites).\r\n\r\nFWIW I do think this is strictly better than the original proposal, so \"3p hints should be off by default unless enabled by Feature Policy\" is not a hill I'd want to die on. Solving this with safe defaults at the FP level sounds okay; I'm a little wary about relying on a completely independent mechanism to enforce good privacy properties of client hints, but it's probably workable -- we'd just need to have the FP-focused discussion about this.",

      "body": "The proposal for the _103 Early Hints_ response contains a few examples referencing (probably caching) intermediaries. For example, to trigger a h2 server-push when an origin sends a 103 carrying `Link` headers. However, there is no explicit definition on what a cache or proxy server may or may not do with 103 responses.\r\n\r\nBy definition, the informational response cannot have any own meta data:\r\n\r\n_\"A client MUST NOT interpret the 103 (Early Hints) response header fields as if they applied to the informational response itself\"._\r\n\r\nObviously, 103 is not among the status codes cacheable by default defined in [RFC7231 6.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.1). Furthermore the response cannot contain an entity body and it must be considered an intermediate response as the final response is still to come. I assume all that forbids storing the 103 in a cache.\r\n\r\nConsidering the objective to speed up Web site delivery, I would like to discuss the idea of adding a mechanism that would allow an intermediary cache to store data from the 103 response.\r\n\r\nIn a CDN-like setup an edge-server first receives an HTTP request and forwards it to the origin. Let's say the final answer took a long time, was private and could not be stored in the cache. However, a 103 intermediate response was received in the mean time and forwarded to the client. For subsequent requests to the same URL (according to the cache key calculation\u2026) the edge cache could send the _cached_ 103 downstream to the client while the original request is sent upstream to the origin _at the same time_. I think this could be a very effective way to use waiting time.\r\n\r\nA similar situation was proposed at the end of section 2, where an _\"intermediary generates a 103 (Early Hints) response based on the header fields of a stale-cached\u00a0response\"_. However, this can only apply to cacheable content. But HTML documents are most often private.\r\n\r\nTo avoid \"guessing\" in intermediaries, we could define a special Cache Control header field accompanying the 103 status, such as `Early-Hint-Control`. An origin could then define a 103 to be cacheable in a proxy server or cache. For subsequent requests the stored 103 could be sent downstream regardless of whether the final response is public or private.\r\n\r\nThe header field could follow the `Cache-Control` semantics. The `public` and `max-age=N` directives seem appropriate. A proxy server would have to store the Early Hint information apart from regular responses (e.g. 200) to not confuse it with a final response. When the field `Early-Hint-Control: public` is not present, the 103 response should not be stored.",

If this setting is not present, the server should not wait for a digest before pushing.\r\n* Server SETTING parameter that tells the client \"I really like to get a cache digest next time around\"\r\n* Client implementations SHOULD/MUST maintain server preference for future sessions, and MAY not send a cache digest if a past session with that server did not include a \"I want a digest\" SETTING parameter.\r\n* On the very first connection to a server, the client's cache is empty, so not sending the digest in that case has no penalty.\r\n",

However, the information is currently tied to the connection instead of the origin.\r\n\r\nThat said, one way of addressing the issue would be to add a way to define per-origin settings to the ORIGIN frame. Considering the fact that the use of the SETTINGS parameters is the suggested way for negotiating features, it would be natural to provide the opportunity to use them at a per-origin basis.",

I would imagine that clients that support CD will always send it; servers that think they know better can ignore it, of course.\r\n\r\nACCEPT_CACHE_DIGEST seems like it's optimised for the case that the browser doesn't want to send CD until it knows the server wants it, and it's OK if it doesn't show up in the first RT or two of the connection -- i.e., the client sends it sometime after the first request, and everyone is willing to wear a bit of inefficiency in the first few pushes, because we assume that there will be further interactions on the connection that can benefit from CD.\r\n\r\nI think I agree that doesn't work so well for 3rd party content. \r\n\r\nHowever, making settings persistent beyond  the scope of a connection is something we've shied away from in the past; it's effectively defining a new kind of cache. Also, from a developer experience perspective, emitting new SETTINGS is not easy from some servers (never mind load balancers, CDNs, etc).\r\n\r\nIf @mikewest's [Origin Policy](https://wicg.github.io/origin-policy/) had any life in it, that might be appropriate here.

I think this will be especially problematic for Expect-CT, which I would expect to be a \"quiet\" header.\r\n\r\nTo that end, I'd like to submit a test report and examine the response. For this to work properly, we need 1) an ability to indicate that a report is being submitted for testing purposes only and 2) for the server to be able to signal if the report is being accepted. With 1, the server can process the test response as it would a real one, but MAY delete it afterwards. With 2, the testing tool can determine if the endpoint is working correctly.\r\n\r\nFor #2, the RFC could be extended with section 3.3 Receiving a violation report, which could say that servers should respond with 200 if they are happy and able to receive a report for the indicated hostname, 4xx if there's something's wrong with the report (e.g., the indicated hostname is not known to the server), and 5xx if there is some other problem.",

To assure that there aren't arbitrary differences between the capabilities / built-in limits of implementations (thereby causing interop or even security issues).\r\n2. To provide fallback limits for authors who forget to specify them.\r\n\r\nI'd also observe that overall header length limits are imposed by HTTP implementations themselves, which is often going to be separate from structured header implementations.\r\n\r\nI think this convinces me that if we define limits, we should keep them  in their current form, and that they should probably be made pretty big (esp. strings) so that they are hit less often.\r\n\r\nCurrent limits / what I propose:\r\n\r\n* Dictionary - 1024 members / 4096 members\r\n* List - 1024 members / 4096 members\r\n* Parameterised Lists (items) - 256 items / 1024 items\r\n* Parameterised Lists (parameters per item) - 256 parameters / 256 parameters\r\n* Strings - 1024 characters / 8192 characters\r\n* Identifiers - 256 characters / 256 characters\r\n* Binary Content -  16384 bytes / 16384 bytes\r\n\r\nThat said, another approach would be to require parsers to support at least so many characters / items / etc., rather than fixing maximums. That would address (1) above but not (2). That might be OK, since overall header length will probably kick in as an abuse control before many of these.\r\n\r\nI think I like that latter approach, but am still getting used to it.\r\n\r\n@annevk - I think an implementation (whether server or client) *could* drop what it knows to be a structured header onto the floor if it violated the limits, but it wouldn't be required; the only requirement is on someone actually running as a parser.\r\n",

The `:protocol` extension to CONNECT was defined for the primary purpose of using WebSockets over an HTTP/2 stream; it just happens to be a general-purpose mechanism we can use for other things too.  And I think the Upgrade registry, being an existing registry which contains protocols that HTTP can upgrade to is probably the right choice when defining a new sort of upgrade within HTTP.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we were redefining the Upgrade registry now, I'd argue for using the ALPN registry for both of these.  Fundamentally, they are both registries of tokens which identify an application-layer protocol which can run over a bytestream.  (Or collection of bytestreams, when used with QUIC.)  The only real restriction is that Upgrade requires that the protocol be able to answer the original HTTP request in the new protocol, which means there has to be a defined mapping between HTTP requests and whatever the new protocol is.\r\n\r\nThe currently-registered values are disjoint, but I wonder if perhaps HTTPter should consider merging the two registries?",

      "body": "This foremost relates to the arbitrary limits that cookie stores place on cookies, both globally and per-domain.\r\n\r\nRFC 6265 says the following:\r\n\r\n>   At any time, the user agent MAY \"remove excess cookies\" from the\r\n>   cookie store if the number of cookies sharing a domain field exceeds\r\n>   some implementation-defined upper bound (such as 50 cookies).\r\n>\r\n>   At any time, the user agent MAY \"remove excess cookies\" from the\r\n>   cookie store if the cookie store exceeds some predetermined upper\r\n>   bound (such as 3000 cookies).\r\n>\r\n>   When the user agent removes excess cookies from the cookie store, the\r\n>   user agent MUST evict cookies in the following priority order:\r\n>\r\n>   1.  Expired cookies.\r\n>\r\n>   2.  Cookies that share a domain field with more than a predetermined\r\n>       number of other cookies.\r\n>\r\n>   3.  All cookies.\r\n>\r\n>   If two cookies have the same removal priority, the user agent MUST\r\n>   evict the cookie with the earliest last-access date first.\r\n\r\nWe did some investigation into this and discovered some problems with this process as implemented.  Browsers tend to remove a fixed number of cookies once they hit storage limits.  From what I can tell, browsers sort by last-access, but remove up to a fixed number of cookies.\r\n\r\nThis is bad for the integrity of storage.  Retaining some, but not all cookies is a great recipe for getting incomplete state. That can be a security exposure. That was part of what made some of the attacks in [this paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-zheng.pdf) possible and motivated the the [leave-secure-cookies-alone](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-leave-secure-cookies-alone) fix.\r\n\r\nWhen we looked at this we first concluded on the following algorithm:\r\n\r\n1. If cookies exceed the limit, remove all cookies for other domains (for `foo.example.com`, remove `(!foo).example.com` cookies, but not example.com cookies).\r\n2. If cookies still exceed the limit, remove all cookies for other paths (for `foo.example.com/foo`, remove `foo.example.com/(!foo)`).\r\n3. If cookies still exceed the limit, remove all related cookies (for `foo.example.com`, remove anything ending in `example.com`).\r\n\r\nOn review, I think that we can continue to use last-access date to drive this, with a much smaller change.  I'm proposing two small changes:\r\n\r\n* Require that last-access is set to the same value for every accessed cookie when constructing the Cookie header field (the text currently says the \"current date and time\".\r\n\r\n* Require that when an unexpired cookie is removed, require that all cookies that share a domain and have the same (or older) last-access date also be removed.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that if a site receives incomplete cookie state, then it is at least an incomplete state that might reasonably have been created by an adjacent site.  For example, say that `foo.example.com` installs and depends on cookies at `example.com`, then if `bar.example.com` triggers deletion, then it will remove only `foo.example.com` cookies.  It can't be perfect because there is a risk that `example.com` cookies are actually specific to `foo.example.com` and have an interdependency on `foo.example.com` cookies, but that's a risk we're already exposed to.\r\n\r\nThis can result in the same results as the algorithm I described above, but it also might allow for more granular removal.  For instance, if `1.example.com` through `9.example.com` are visited in that order and `9.example.com` causes cookies to exceed the limit, then cookies will be removed for `1.example.com` first The algorithm above would cause cookies for 1 through 8 to be removed at once, which is more severe than we need.\r\n\r\nAs the people driving this no longer work for Mozilla, I thought that I would record our conclusions.  I don't know if we have the resources to continue to investigate implementation, but I'm happy to create a PR for the relevant section if the WG thinks that this is a reasonable change.\r\n\r\nI understand that @mikewest still prefers [cookie priorities](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-priority), but no one at Mozilla has any interest in that solution and it didn't seem to get any traction when we discussed it before.",

I have anecdotal stories of similar dependency in other companies, but nothing I can point to public statements to justify.\r\n\r\nI recognize that other vendors are unlikely to ship the attribute. I'm very open to reviewing the results of y'all's experimentation to see if the results in other browsers show that we're making the wrong choice in Chrome, but my (biased) opinion at the moment is that `Priority` solves this problem in a way that puts developers more directly in control of the eviction process, and that that control is concretely valuable in scenarios that run up against the vendor-specified limits on a regular basis.",

Traditionally when building API's there's often been a need to be able to express a 'collection' and an 'item'.\r\n\r\nA big reason for needing this, is that we can't ask the client to do a GET request for every individual item in a collection, so they get bunched together into some kind of collection resource.\r\n\r\nHowever, those collection resources still contain some kind of representation of the item in the collection, and can often indicate to the client what real item they refer to.\r\n\r\nA real example of this is [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html). If you're unfamiliar with HAL, it actually expresses collections though an \"_embedded\" format. It almost literally expresses:\r\n\r\n> \"Here is a collection. To save you time and bandwidth, we're embedding the representations of all the resources that are contained within the collection\"\r\n\r\nMany formats will have some variation of this idea. But the idea is not perfect. Specifically:\r\n\r\n* HTTP caches will not be aware or understand embedded items, and will not invalidate embedded items if they got a new copy.\r\n* It's often only possible to embed items that are identical to the parent format (in my case HAL).\r\n* It's often possible to include additional request/response headers.\r\n\r\nThe more I've been thinking about this and generic clients, I feel that HTTP/2 push is a great solution for this. A conforming client can just pretend do GET requests that come from the push-cache. I've started testing with this, and conceptually I think it works really well.\r\n\r\nThis could all be done without cache-digest, but the ability to only push resource states that have changed is just such a powerful idea to me.\r\n\r\nHowever, in my mind ETag is the right mechanism for this. I think the statistics you cited are right, but HTTP/2 push and Cache-Digests can be an enabler for this type of technology. Rarely APIs will know in advance how long resources should be cacheable, because changes are usually based on user actions.",

Servers can look for bad DNS records or BGP hijacking to detect attacks without ORIGIN, but now those techniques don't work.

Previously, with coalescing, you would need to have a certificate that has both your own origin and the victim's origin, so that would be visible in a CT log.\r\n\r\nSubcerts can help with this (they have much shorter lifetimes).",

In particular, an origin is unable to restrict non-HTTP APIs from setting cookies on a host or domain.  While perhaps this is a nice-to-have for hosts (APIs operating in the origin context can do lots of other things), it is a major problem unique to cookies for domains.  \r\n\r\nA multi-tenant domain (with independent origins under it) has no in-band way to prevent cookies from being set on the entire domain (ie, to restrict cookies to same-site).  The only option available there is to put the domain on a public-suffix list which isn't always scale-able or operationally maintainable.\r\n\r\nIt may also be worth considering a response header that servers could send to constrain all cookies to same-site as part of this, either with \"Content-Security-Policy: cookie-scope host\" or as a separate response header specific to this use-case.  For example, a \"Restrict-Cookies\" response header with tokens matching the new features of 6265bis (same-site, secure-only, none) that would constrain behaviors of non-HTTP APIs.\r\n",

If we are going to put secrets in header fields, as is our wont, then the encoding and decoding processes need to be constant time.  Now, we don't really know how to do that perfectly, but a limited grammar makes it more likely that we get it right.\r\n\r\nNow, the forgiving algorithms aren't actually all that forgiving.  As far as I can tell, they are lax about padding and trailing bits. Given that, they would be perfectly good in this context.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I generally prefer the URL-safe variants because you get the following sort of thing less often, which is not good from a security perspective:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nbase64.encode(x).replace(/\\+/g, '-').replace(/\\//g, '_')\r\n```",

Let preferred-types be a list of the types in the request-value, ordered by their weight, highest to lowest, as per [RFC7231] Section 5.3.2 (omitting any coding with a weight of 0). If \u201cAccept\u201d is not present or empty, preferred-types will be empty. If a type lacks an explicit weight, an implementation MAY assign one.\r\n\r\nI see the bug in the examples; will fix.\r\n\r\nOrdering by weight is applying the `q` value. \r\n\r\nIt's not appropriate to make a blanket statement, because not all headers that use `Variants` will define its use (e.g., the various [Client Hints](http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints.html)).

That is because resource versions with many different datetimes can exist in both resource versioning systems and web archives. In order to convey all  datetime values that could be used for datetime negotiation, an approach to provide these values by-reference rather than by-value would be required. Currently, I assume that datetime negotiation is the only negotiation for which this problem exists but with explorations of other negotiation dimensions on the way (e.g. [fine grained content negotiation](https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/fine-grained-content-negotiation/)) that may change.",

I wonder whether that will remain the case, though (see e.g.  [fine grained content negotiation](https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/fine-grained-content-negotiation/)) and as such I also wonder whether a new mechanism to support content negotiation - `Variants` - shouldn't be future proof with this regard?",

It's definitely going to be inappropriate for some use cases, and this limitation is already documented.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

We send `SameSite=Lax` cookies along with \"safe\" HTTP methods (e.g. `GET`, but not `POST`). Chrome's implementation applies the same restriction to `SameSite=Lax` creation. I assumed that Firefox's implementation did the same, but @ericlaw1979 suggests in https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=837412#c18 that it doesn't. That seems strange to me, though perhaps justifiable given the use case Eric's pointing to.\r\n\r\nI think I could live with a world in which top-level navigations (regardless of method) are empowered to _create_ `SameSite` cookies (but keep the rules around _sending_ them as they are).

We maintain this property in the following way. \r\n\r\nFirst, we calculate an offset, which is based on the fingerprint. Crucially, this offset is always odd: `offset = makeOdd(hash(fingerprint))`. \r\n\r\nThis offset is then either subtracted or added to the current position to get the other index. If the current index is odd, it's subtracted. If it's even, it's added. Since the offset is always the same, this jumps between the two possible indices. Further, because adding or subtracting an odd number always flips the evenness or oddness of a number, this guarantees that one position is always even and one is always odd.\r\n\r\nOne additional detail is that this property is maintained under modular arithmetic so long as the modulus is even, which is why the table size must be even.\r\n\r\nIn pseudo code, it looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmakeOdd(x) = x    [if x is odd]\r\n             x+1  [if x is even]\r\n\r\nflipIndex(currentIndex) = currentIndex - makeOdd(hash(fingerprint)) % tableSize   [if currentIndex is odd]\r\n                          currentIndex + makeOdd(hash(fingerprint)) % tableSize   [if currentIndex is even]\r\n```",

IMO, it is essentially the same as omitting the last bit of the fingerprint (and hard-coding it as `1` instead) when we use XOR-based approach.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to state here is that while I can understand the potential benefit of using the approach for tables that do not have the size of power-of-two, I do not see a benefit for the cache-digest use-case adopting that approach, under the assumption that the clients would resize the table using exponential backoff.",

That would require HTTP offering some abstraction in front of H/1, H/2 and probably QUIC that takes headers where the values can be either byte sequences or types and then serializes them as appropriate for the eventual chosen transport.\r\n\r\nFetch could then change its \"header\" primitive so values would be either byte sequences or types and pass that on to the new HTTP abstraction. And also use the H/1 / H/2 serialization for its API, which isn't typed.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, proposed by @mikewest I think, structured headers could define how to obtain a byte sequence from a type. We'd continue passing byte sequences around. Then a future H/N could eagerly parse those bytes to see if it can represent them as a type instead. You'd end up with a redundant serialize/parse, but all the interfaces don't have to be changed. Implementations could optimize the serialize/parse away.

Using identifiers requires a very simple parser. And when we use origins we don't want to parse them as origins, but we want to compare them byte-for-byte.

          "body": "_straw-man; needs references_\r\n\r\n## Privacy Considerations \r\n\r\nHTTP clients can expose a variety of information to servers. Besides information that's explicitly sent as part of an application's operation (for example, names and other user-entered data), other information can be gathered through less obvious means -- often by connecting activities of a user over time. \r\n\r\nThis includes session information, tracking the client through fingerprinting, and mobile code.\r\n\r\n**Session information** includes things like the IP address of the client, TLS session tickets, Cookies, ETags stored in the client's cache, and other stateful mechanisms. Applications SHOULD avoid using session mechanisms unless they are unavoidable or necessary for operation; these risks SHOULD be documented and implementations SHOULD be encouraged to allow clearing such state.\r\n\r\n**Fingerprinting** uses unique aspects of a client's messages and behaviours to connect disparate requests and connections. For example, the `User-Agent` request header conveys specific information about the implementation; the `Accept-Language` request header conveys the users' preferred language. In combination, a number of these markers can be used to uniquely identify a client, impacting its control over its data. As a result, applications SHOULD only emit the information they need to function in requests.\r\n\r\nFinally, if an application exposes the ability to run **mobile code**, great care needs to be taken, since any ability to observe its environment can be used as an opportunity to both fingerprint the client and to obtain and manipulate private data (including session information). For example, access to high-resolution timers (even indirectly) can be used to profile the underlying hardware, creating a unique identifier for the system. Applications SHOULD avoid allowing the use of mobile code where possible; when it cannot be avoided, the resulting system's security properties MUST be deeply scrutinised.\r\n",

I guess a \"header list\" should be able to store typed values and there's a typed-value getter that either returns the typed-value for a given header, parses a legacy-value into one if there's no typed-value, or returns none if there's neither, or failure if parsing failed. And if we start setting these values we'd always pass on typed values to the HTTP subsystem which then decides based the connection how to serialize these.)",

The only way this would make sense is if it was French content aimed at English speakers (e.g. a French course for English speakers) but that's a bit of an edge case so presume that is that the intention here? Shouldn't the Content-Language either be fr, or the Content be in English so they match? It looks like it was in previous drafts but then it was flipped around, so not sure if this got missed or if I'm completely missing the point.\r\n\r\nMoving on we have the new example using the same request:\r\n```\r\nGET /foo HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.example.com\r\nAccept-Language: en;q=0.5, fr;q=1.0\r\n```\r\nand the new response with the additional proposed syntax:\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\nContent-Language: en\r\nVary: Accept-Language\r\nVariants: Accept-Language;de;en;jp\r\nVariant-Key: en\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\n[French content]\r\n```\r\nHere it says there are German, English and Japanese versions (and no French version), and I've decided to send you the English version, and then it gives French content?

          "body": "@annevk Thank you for your comments. Could you please check if my understanding (stated below) is correct?\r\n\r\nWhen evaluating a link rel=preload header, the browser blocks the preload depending on the value of the \"as\" attribute. For example, loading of a image specified by the link header field is blocked, if the URL being contained is not allowed by the img-src property of the CSP header field.\r\n\r\nBy reading https://github.com/w3c/preload/issues/37, I think that that is the expected behavior of preload.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the above is correct, I agree with you that the specs should be interpreted that they ban fetching certain types of resources until the CSP value gets fixed in the final response. Such types includes images and fonts (the spec talks about blocking \"loads\"). OTOH, the rule does not apply to scripts or stylesheets, because CSP deals about \"executing\" or \"applying\" them.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, based on my understanding about CSP (stated above), I wonder preload referring to CSP has any value in terms of security (even though I think that it is a good optimization), because a server can always lie the value of the \"as\" attribute. For example, a server could send a link rel=preload header with as=style to initiate a load of a \".jpg\" file, even in case CSP is set to \"img-src=none\".\r\n\r\nTo summarize, I would argue that the specs do not prevent us from fetching scripts or stylesheets designated by link rel=preload headers in a 103 response. I also argue that there is no need to block fetching other types of resources found in the 103 response.",

While the spec at large is straightforward and reads well, I think `Content-DPR` could benefit from a concrete example of how it might be used by the client. Currently, the spec says the following of `Content-DPR` in [section 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints-06#section-4):\r\n\r\n> The client can use this information to perform additional processing on the resource - for example, calculate the appropriate intrinsic size of the image resource such that it is displayed at the correct resolution.\r\n\r\nThis seems a bit vague to me. Does Chrome act on this response header a specific way? Are implementing browsers _expected_ to? And what's a specific example where that may be the case? Does any suboptimal behavior result when DPR is _not_ confirmed with `Content-DPR`, and if so, what instances?",

The example in section 4 could use some fleshing-out!\r\n\r\nJeremey\u2019s questions are all about describing how `Content-DPR` is actually used on the front end \u2013 I'll add that I think there should be more about how the server in the example calculated the `Content-DPR: 1` that it sends back.

E.g. sending down a 200x200 image with `Content-DPR: 2` and no other layout information, would mean the image is laid out ass a 100x100 image.\r\n\r\n> Does any suboptimal behavior result when DPR is _not_ confirmed with `Content-DPR`, and if so, what instances?\r\n\r\nYeah, the wrong density corrected intrinsic dimensions. In order to notice that, you'd need your images layout to not be constrained by other means (e.g. CSS).\r\n\r\n> what should servers do, if they don't have both a `Width` and a `DPR`?\r\n\r\nThat depends on the server. Servers should restrict the image dimensions to `Viewport-Width` as images are typically not wider than that, but lacking more specific width information, it's tricky to restrict the images further.",

For nascent or underdocumented technologies, it's not uncommon for developers to seek out specs to understand how they work.\r\n\r\nI claim ignorance of the nuanced interactions between specifications and implementations. Yet, I can't see how improving clarity around this in the specification itself could be bad for developers _or_ implementors. In a spec that clearly and superbly explains the vast majority of concepts and behaviors surrounding client hints, I personally felt this (and the issue raised in #698) lacked clarity in authoritative sources. While I understand now how `Content-DPR` works (as well as the concepts referenced in #698), the knowledge was hard-won in my initial research.\r\n\r\nThat said, if it makes sense to define this behavior elsewhere, I'm supportive.

Thanks!\r\n\r\nThe only case I can make for `downlinkMax` might be that it would be useful for knowing when downstream conditions improve for the client. Such as a client starts off with a low downstream speed on the navigation request, but subsequent resource requests show an improvement in `downlink` values. But in all honesty, if pressed to defend `downlinkMax` (or `Downlink-Max` as I've suggested here), applications can track `downlink` values across all resource requests and figure that out on their own.\r\n\r\nA better title for this issue might be \"Consider making network-related client hints congruent with netinfo\", since congruency between the two would reduce confusion and allow spec readers to readily see a 1:1 relationship between hints available in netinfo and network hints available in CH.",

The way I see it, the reasoning is:\r\n\r\n* We want to have confidence that those headers do not conflict with current server logic before declaring them CORS-safe. Adding `Sec-` prefix reduces the probability of such collision. The alternative is to add somewhat complex logic to the CORS safety logic, making sure that values that users are setting are \"valid\" ones.\r\n* Making sure these headers can only be set by the User Agent itself will add further confidence to Servers when processing those headers, as attackers won't be able to set them from JS with arbitrary values.\r\n* Preventing SW from adding those headers will also simplify the processing somewhat (although that part is still being [discussed](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/880)\r\n\r\nDoes that make our motivation for this clearer?",

However, that may complicate the Fetch processing model and it's not clear it is required.\r\n",

As a known use case, websites that offer multiple languages may allow a user to set a cookie which determines which language. When that value is not present in a cookie, the server falls back to using Accept-Language or some other alternate.\r\n\r\nI think this specification should perhaps make some clarity over Cookies doing this kind of override, even if it may fit into the Vary section (as servers implementing this probably are using `Vary: Cookie`)",

Some client and server implementations may not be prepared to deal with byte position values of 2^63 and beyond. So in applications where there's no expectation that the representation will ever exceed 2^63, a value smaller than this value should be used as the very large last-byte-pos in a byte-seek request or content-range response. Also, some implementations (e.g. JavaScript-based clients and servers) are not able to represent all values beyond 2^53. So similarly, if there's no expectation that a representation will ever exceed 2^53 bytes, values smaller than this limit should be used for the last-byte-pos in byte-range requests.\r\n\r\nI think that the decision we make here should be aligned to this.",

If this is really just about saving an implementer a small amount of *effort*, I'm firmly on the side of giving users the most range we reasonably can.\r\n\r\n(2) will catch cases when a parser can process a string that contains a value that's not within bounds, but then somehow ends up with something that is. There are cases where that's demonstrably true (e.g., `3e5`), but we can catch those with a combination of further pre-processing steps (e.g., \"if the string contains anything but a digit, fail parsing\") and tests.\r\n\r\nIs there a case where invalid input will evade those pre-processing steps and still produce a valid output? My understanding that excessive values can cause imprecision once you exceed a threshold, but the returned value is never below that threshold (in the case of JS above 2^53).\r\n",

      "body": "The way HTTP/2 dependencies work requires the client and server to maintain dependency trees that are (at least somewhat) in sync.\r\n\r\nWhen the client starts a new stream as a child of an existing stream it provides the parent stream ID. If the parent stream ID is unknown to the server then the dependency information is [thrown away and the stream is given a default priority](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-5.3.1).\r\n\r\nIn practice this is causing racy issues with Chrome's dependency tree and some server implementations. Chrome attempts to build a linear list of streams with each stream exclusively dependent on the stream before it. Higher priority streams are placed in the list ahead of lower priority streams. Each stream is also assigned a weight that maps to Chrome's internal \"priority\" though the weight is largely inconsequential when the dependency ordering is working because each request is always exclusively dependent on the parent in a list.\r\n\r\n![start](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/444165/50975374-6f48e980-14bb-11e9-85fe-5c17e848f6ff.png)\r\n\r\nWhen a new stream is initiated that is a higher priority than the end of the list it is attached as an exclusive dependent of the last stream in the list with a higher priority (inserting it into the ordered priority list):\r\n\r\n![insert](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/444165/50975460-a7e8c300-14bb-11e9-9d0b-3cb4af50b687.png)\r\n\r\nThis is where things get racy. If the server has already sent the last part of the new parent stream but the bytes are in-flight and the client doesn't know the stream has closed yet it is possible that the server no longer knows about the parent stream that the new stream is trying to attach to. When that happens, the new stream is given a default priority (weight 16 and attached to the root).\r\n\r\n![after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/444165/50975592-f6965d00-14bb-11e9-91c3-797a0f9b9fe8.png)\r\n\r\nAt this point, what was supposed to be a high-priority stream inserted ahead of streams 5-9 is now a parallel stream with a MUCH lower weight, effectively starving it and largely delaying it until all of the requests in the original list complete.\r\n\r\nThis issue was exposed with my initial [HTTP/2 prioritization test](https://github.com/pmeenan/http2priorities) which flagged both Google's and h2o's HTTP/2 implementations as not working because the race condition was being triggered. I don't know how often it happens in the wild.\r\n\r\nh2o has mitigated the issues somewhat by remembering a set number of completed streams, reducing the likelihood that a completed stream will be needed as a parent but it is still possible to trigger depending on the size of in-flight buffers and the size of the high-priority requests (a lot of small streams and large buffers can still exhaust the dead-stream list).\r\n\r\nAdding support for something like a FIN ACK from the client when a stream completes and only deleting streams on the server when ACK'd should at least make it deterministic.\r\n\r\nAs the HTTP/3 spec is being finalized, it might be worth considering if a stateful dependency tree is really needed or if a stateless prioritization scheme more similar to what SPDY originally used might be easier (both for servers and browsers).",

I actually thought the document cycle was over - but this draft has been on such a slow burn (and I've had so much go into and out of my brain) that the process never crystalized in my head - despite a couple taps with the clue stick by Patrick and company. If there was an IETF dunce cap, I'd nominate myself for it...]\r\n\r\nAnyway, whether the content is transferred as chunked or non-chunked is actually orthogonal to the to whether the content is static or live/aggregating - and also orthogonal to Range - unless there's something I'm missing? (I see Chunked in the \"how to transfer\" category and content type/Range are \"what to transfer\" category)\r\n\r\nSpecifically, for strictly live content (non random-access), you can transfer it chunked or non-chunked. Chunked allows the sender to more explicitly signal the end of the live streaming - and allow the connection to stay open - by sending a 0-length chunk. In non-chunked transfer of live content, the sender has to close the connection when the live streaming is completed (since Content-Length can't be provided). (discussing only HTTP 1.1 here)\r\n\r\nSo yeah - this entire draft is discussing how to support live content that also has random access support - and is titled accordingly. But as is the case with non-random-access live streaming, content transfer of Range responses can be chunked or non-chunked. \r\n\r\nI intentionally left out \"Content-Length\" headers from the examples because that would imply non-chunked responses and I didn't want to confuse people. And while I could discuss both chunked and non-chunked response forms, I was trying to keep the draft focused/short - and I wanted to keep it future-proof by not discussing transfer forms (esp in the world of HTTP/2+). I also didn't discuss non-random-access live content (as a \"remedial/background\" section for similar reasons.\r\n\r\nI'd like to get this (experimental) draft \"out there\" and get some feedback from implementors on what's working/not working (and what need to be better clarified/described). But if there's a real issue with comprehension we should address it in this draft. So let me know if you think this falls into that latter category. (this is all something I need to tell myself or I'll keep editing forever)\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I'm writing this off the top of my head - and haven't been working in HTTP specs for a while. So please correct me if I missed some rule about chunking, Range, etc.",

The obvious HIT and MISS actions came first.\r\n\r\n2. Then we quickly discovered that a \"we found it in the cache\" HIT\r\naction is often followed by a REFRESH action (and a resulting MISS from\r\nthe proxy-server traffic point of view). HIT_REFRESH... concatenations\r\nwere used to combat this.\r\n\r\n3. Realizing that even fresh cache HITs may become misses due to various\r\nprotocol requirements and internal problems, some added X-Cache-Lookup\r\nthat was dedicated to the first (and often critical for triage) cache\r\nlookup, depicting what happened to that HIT later in X-Cache.\r\n\r\n4. Then flash crowds and collapsed forwarding solutions came along. Now,\r\na single client HIT or MISS request could cause even more transactions,\r\nsome of which could be cache hits, some could be revalidations or even\r\nerrors. Some added COLLAPSED_HIT_REFRESH... and/or other variants. This\r\nconcatenation approach still loses a lot of info, but it highlights the\r\nfact that a lot of info could be lost by including the COLLAPSED tag.\r\n\r\nIf the goal here is to standardize the current status quo, then the\r\ndocument should cover Cache-Lookup and COLLAPSED tags (and/or their\r\nvariations).\r\n\r\nIf the goal here is to standardize a scalable solution based on the\r\ncurrent experience, then we should combine Cache-Lookup and Cache while\r\nenumerating individual cache actions as separate same-node entries\r\n(instead of trying to merge them into a single FOO_BAR_BAZ super-action\r\nsummary for one node).",

This is not mentioned in the IETF draft, as it's a feature that will **use** the CH infrastructure, and as such, is defined [elsewhere](https://github.com/WICG/ua-client-hints).\r\n\r\n> I am aware of this conversation, i referenced a commit in mentioned in #215 above for example :) . But in general, im not sure I understand the connection to the above issues to the concern here, which is \"values in headers get treated categorically differently, and persisted longer, than variables in JS\" :)\r\n\r\nTrackers rarely inspect fingerprinting data using JS APIs and then keep it on the device's memory. They typically send it to their servers, often as URL query parameters, which are arguably an order of magnitude more likely to be persisted in logs than HTTP headers.\r\n\r\n> 1. middle parties (CDN, proxies, other HTTP terminators) get access to data they would previously would not have had access too\r\n\r\nSince Client-Hints are exposed only over secure connections, I suppose you meant \"TLS terminators\" above?\r\n\r\nCDNs do get access to that data, which enables them to perform their duties and use it for content negotiation purposes. They also have full access to the content as TLS terminators, so arguably could also have access to that data by running arbitrary JS on their customers sites. As CDNs are fully trusted by their customers not to do that unless the customer asks them to, I don't think they are the threat model here.\r\n\r\nAlso, anecdotally, I've never heard of a CDN that keeps around the logs of all their customers request and response headers. If they would, cookies are likely to present a bigger concern than fingerprinting bit leakage. But if you have examples to the contrary, I'd love to hear them.\r\n\r\nAs for other TLS terminators (e.g. MITM proxies), they can similarly inject arbitrary JS and leak arbitrary data. I doubt CH increases that attack surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> * that data is more likely to be persisted in long term logs than if its collected \"actively\" in JS\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced that this is in fact the case. And again, acquiring the data in JS does not equate keeping that data in JS. It is leaked over the network, typically as URL params.\r\n\r\n\r\n> 3\\. HTTP logs, that may now include these values, are often shared with third parties, furthering privacy risk.\r\n\r\nAny specific examples of HTTP logs that contain *all header values*? I don't see [Apache logs](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html#accesslog) doing that, at least not by default. Similarly for Nginx, I don't see any headers there. I do see the URL though.",

          "body": "To respond to some of the issues mentioned above @yoavweiss @yadij :\r\n\r\nRe: CH (does/does not) makes logging privacy issues worse\r\n\r\nI'm having trouble understanding the claim here.  I am going to see if I can repeat the thinking behind the argument that \"CH aids FP prevention / detection\" argument.  If I am off base here, please kindly correct, I'm making an honest effort to get on the same page.\r\n\r\nThe arguments are:\r\n## 1) Clients can say no easier\r\n* Right now sites use a bunch of JS values to determine things like what images to send\r\n* In a post-CH world, servers will expect clients to respond with headers, and so wont rely on JS values\r\n* Clients can easy detect when these CH values are being requested, and can choose not to respond\r\n* Therefor, CH allows clients to protect their privacy, since its easier to detect and say no, than the status quo\r\n\r\n## 2) logging concerns are a push\r\n* When sites use JS values to determine these kinds of things, they are often put in URLs, and so wind up in logs already\r\n* Middle men can already inject JS\r\n\r\n## 3) Depreciation of current JS end points\r\n* CH is a net win because some JS end points will be deprecated\r\n\r\nAssuming this is a correct understanding of the argument, my concerns are the following\r\n\r\n* I am aware of the suggestion to deprecate UA access in JS (as you mentioned @yoavweiss we discussed it at the F2F), but I am not aware of any suggestion to depreciate the other related JS endpoints (and some of them, like viewport dimensions, seem impossible to hide in JS space).  If there are suggestions to remove `navigator.deviceMemory`, DPR values, etc in some proposal somewhere, I would be very grateful for the link :)\r\n* I understand the claim that clients can say no to a CH request easily, but the likely scenario is that servers ask for the info in CH, and then if the client says no, they extract it in JS.  This is the pattern we see for all sorts of tracking libs; the server / party / JS tries to get as many signals as possible, not just the highest level one.  Adding the info to the CH layer strictly makes the situation no better, and in some cases  worse (since, unless the client says no 100% of the time, values are exposed to parties that otherwise wouldn't have them).\r\n* Point taken that these values can already escape into some URLs.  No question there.  But there is just a world of difference between every website using its own, bespoke URL patterns, and a universal, well structured header field.  There is no need for the client to be complicit and make things _easier_ for the tracking party.\r\n* I appreciate the point that CDN / TLS terminating parties (not HTTP terminating, thank you for the correction :) ) can inject JS.  The concern here is how much tracking information a curious but honest party can see, not a malicious party (since in that case, all bets are off already\u2026).  Its not a matter of the server trusting the CDN, the focus is client information winding up in more, easily extractable places.\r\n\r\nAlso, fwiw, for examples of logs that collect all header data, the mod_log_forensic module, on the website you linked too, is one example. Systems like snort and bro, want full HTTP header logs, etc.  More to the point though, the expectation is that as more track-able information winds up in these headers, more parties will become interested in them.

My position is that CH is would result in something worse than current practice, for multiple reasons:\r\n\r\n1) Third parties gain access to finger-printable values that they currently don't have access too (finger-printable values would now be in well structured CH headers and seen by CDNs / TLS terminators, where before they were either absent or ay worse sometimes indirectly available in unstructured URLs)\r\n2) Finger-printable values are show up in locations where they are likely to persist for longer (in HTTP logs for above)\r\n3) Finger-printable values are shared to first parties (and delegated parties) in more ways.  Previously browsers needed to defend against JS based determinations, now they need to defend against JS based determinations AND header-extractions.\r\n",

          "body": "Thanks for the clarification.\r\n\r\nI think you need to qualify (1). As discussed, CH is currently only sent over TLS, and so from the perspective of the web, is communication between two parties. It's true that some sites contract out some of their server capabilities to others (CDNs, cloud hosts, data centres, etc.) but those are generally still considered first-party interactions, because the entity in question is acting on behalf of the owner of the server, and that relationship is typically overseen by a legal agreement, as well as various rights and responsibilities in different jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nAlso, \"third party\" generally is used to refer to off-site services with a different origin; e.g., ads., so it's a bit confusing to use it here.\r\n\r\nTerminology aside, there is some precedent for the argument you're making in (2), but generally when the community has been concerned about sensitive data being logged, it's been because it appears in URLs, which were (originally) designed to be written down, logged, etc. Extending that argument to include headers in an encrypted connection is new. That's not a roadblock, but it would help immensely to establish and get agreement upon the underlying principle.\r\n\r\nFor (3), I think the basis of the decision is likely to be whether the added functionality -- including privacy improvements, as we're seeing discussed in Mike West's `User-Agent` replacement discussion -- balances out the increased complexity. More information on both sides would probably help, although I do note that browsers haven't been terribly shy of complexity to date...\r\n\r\nAre you likely to be coming to the IETF meeting in Prague?

I'm happy to change terminology if it eases the conversation, but the concern seems pretty straight forward.  User X wants to visit website Y who sits behind CDN (or similar) Z.  Currently, if Z wants to extract these fingerprinting-sensitive values from X's conversation with Y, it requires some out of band communication with Y (access to Y's DB, or something like that, assuming Y is storing them).  In a CH-world, Z gets well-structured access to those values, in a way they don't currently have.

Is it helpful frame it as: \r\n\r\n> \"privacy on the web, and in the growth of web standards, has been a demonstrable catastrophe.  The first principal when proposing new standards should be \"do no harm\", or failing that, \"here is an _extremely_ compelling goal (e.g. not moderate perf improvements) that justifies further harm to privacy\".  Adding finger-printable values to HTTP headers, in such a way that they can be easily collected, aggregated and shared en mass, is a significant privacy harm.\r\n\r\n(3) The concern here is not about implementation complexity.  Just to try and reach some point of agreement, so that we can discuss further from there:\r\n\r\nSetting aside the UA aspect, and dealing only with viewport height/width, DPR, ECT and DeviceMemory, etc: can we agree that CH is strictly a harm for privacy?  In the best case (user agent declines the server's request for the headers, site falls back to JS based value extraction) its a push, and in all other cases its a loss (fingerprinting values are in more locations than they were before, and accessible by more parties).\r\n\r\nIf we don't agree to the above, i would greatly appreciate it if you could clarify by way of the following: what is a scenario where a) the server / website wants to get access to finger-printable values, and b) the client doesn't want to yield them, that CH helps improve privacy?

I hope the above examples help explain.  Also, making the same data in multiple places (and a different set of parties), making it much easier for middle parties to log and preserve the FP values, and relying on browsers to deploy additional countermeasure / standards-deviations to avoid further privacy harm are all examples of additional privacy risk / loss in the standard.\r\n\r\nBut happy to have reached a point where we're at least not arguing that CH somehow _reduces_ FP surface: (e.g. https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/767#issuecomment-463351465) \ud83d\ude00",

So there is no _separate_ model. All privacy and security aspects for \"origin\" also apply to CDN.\r\n\r\nYou keep stating that CH expands the exposure. But look at the exposure scopes in the threat matrix I list below.\r\n\r\n\r\nsnyderp :\r\n> But happy to have reached a point where we're at least not arguing that CH somehow reduces FP surface: (e.g. #767 (comment)) grinning\r\n\r\nThat was a statement by me. AFAIK yoav has never had that position.\r\nFTR my position remains that CH (alone) has better privacy than the status quo (JS hacks). Consider these two scenarios:\r\n\r\n scenario 1: a request arrives for some random URL. This URL is stored, logged, and passed around. The response to this request has a response lacking cacheability headers. For performance vague responses *are* cached. Due to the permutability of query-string values there may be N copies of this URL+object stored in M caches around the world - for potentially 68 year long timespans.\r\n => even with HTTPS protection the FP data can be retrieved from any of these intermediary data sources long after the transaction is over.\r\n\r\n scenario 2: a request arrives with C-H header details. The URL is clean - so no danger from logging and passing that around within the intermediary system. The request C-H headers (being request headers) are not cached with the response (if they are used by Vary/Key etc it is in the form of a crypto hash).\r\n => the clients FP data is only ever in memory during the transaction active period, is never seen by most of the intermediary system components, and cannot be recovered from the long-term storage.\r\n\r\nSo tell me again how scenario #1 is better for privacy?\r\n\r\nsynderp : \r\n>  In the best case (user agent declines the server's request for the headers, site falls back to JS based value extraction)\r\n\r\nThat is actually a case near worst-case.\r\n\r\nThe exposure matrix is a 2x3 [ [JS, CH], [send, fallback, omit] ]. So these:\r\n\r\nJS-only (the status quo):\r\n - FP exposure to all HTTP agents along the path\r\n - FP exposure to all log processors\r\n - FP exposure to all filesystem agents\r\n - FP exposure to other networking services on intermediary host\r\n - FP exposure to any services the above leak URL and/or cache data to\r\n - expected persistent FP exposure to all the above for up to 68 years\r\n\r\nCH-only\r\n - FP data only by request.\r\n - conclusion: less FP data, therefore less exposure than status quo.\r\n - FP exposure to all HTTP agents along the path\r\n - conclusion: less agent types, therefore less exposure than status quo.\r\n\r\nCH with JS fallback\r\n - client is forwarned of FP actions so can proactively close off JS APIs\r\n - bias toward CH-only exposure, with risks of status quo amounts of FP exposure.\r\n - conclusion: less or equal FP exposure to status quo.\r\n\r\nJS with CH fallback\r\n - bias towards status quo FP exposure.\r\n - conclusion: equal FP exposure to status quo.\r\n\r\nBoth CH and JS data\r\n  - CH exposure is a sub-set of JS exposure.\r\n  - conclusion: equal FP exposure to status quo.\r\n\r\nNeither\r\n - no FP exposure within scope of the model.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne may argue that agents without JS support are being added to the exposure set. However I counter that the FP data is already visible to such agents in the form of URL values. The presence of FP data in URLs is already where the worst types of leaks are occuring with the JS-only approach. Simply closing off those major avenues of exposure is the reduction in surface I referred to earlier and still believe is offered by CH.",

There are a million bespoke ways this information could be encoded in a URL, some easy to pragmatically extract (e.g. query params), some not (e.g. packed into custom formatted blobs).

CH makes whats currently a difficult, constantly changing, not-generally-solveable problem into something trivial, exactly the kind of thing that could be trivially automated, aggregated and sold / shared / leaked.\r\n\r\nTo put it a different way, given a set of 1m requests in a log, would you rather be the person in charge of coding up a system for extracting viewport-width, DPR, ECT, DeviceMemory, etc values from those logs in a pre, or a post, CH world. :)\r\n\r\n> however, it also makes it easier to identify sensitive information for purposes of research / analysis / blocking / etc.\r\n\r\nGiven the amount of literature documenting how often these end points are already abused, I don't think this counts as a \"win\".  We already know people abuse this stuff!  There is no win in making it **easier to count** the abuse; the win is in making it **harder to conduct** the abuse.",

While they _may_ resort to malicious attacks (traffic tampering, etc) the primary concern is the honest-but-curious scenario, where they maximize the utility of the data they can gain w/o breaking protocol (i.e. they squeeze every $ out of every data point they can see, but don't modify traffic, inject JS, etc).\r\n\r\nI hope this helps @mnot .  CH is privacy harmful because it increases the amount of fingerprinting middle parties can do, by taking something they can only occasionally do now (extracting FP parameters from URLs, by trying a variety of faulty, imperfect, non-generalizeable pattern matching strategies) and changing it into something they can do trivially (reading HTTP header values).",

Clients have no way of distinguishing whether they are talking to a TLS-terminating CDN or a non-CDN'ed site, so this essentially proposes a security boundary which cannot be enforced by clients. This means that any information which should not be revealed to these \"middle parties\" must be denied for all parties.\r\n2. There is nothing in any browser's UX that I know of which indicates to the user whether they are talking to a TLS-terminating CDN versus the site's server directly. Even if (1) were possible, this seems like a tricky concept to communicate to users.\r\n3. Cookies are sent as a header and are usually more of a privacy/security risk than the client-hints header. Does this mean we should deprecate cookies in favor of JS-accessible state storage mechanisms like localStorage?\r\n\r\nRe: the claim that headers are more likely to be logged, I too would like to see some data for this. It seems that if this is a concern, we should be equally or more concerned that CDNs are logging cookies (which are also sent as headers).\r\n\r\nThe most convincing argument I see for not implementing CH at this time is that it adds complexity and another vector which must be blocked when the client blocks data that CH would otherwise send. (For instance, if a user blocks scripts or installs an extension to block certain fingerprinting vectors, the browser must make sure the data is correspondingly blocked in CH.)\r\n",

My point was that sometimes specs use \"MUST send\" when\nthe sender doesn't know, resulting in stupid values appearing. That's\nexactly what led a number of agents to place a content-length with stupid\nvalues (0 or huge ones) with the CONNECT method a long time ago.\n\nAn empty value where an integer is needed by the application is more of\nan application-level error than a protocol-level one in my opinion : it's\nup to the application to decide how to recover from this missing piece of\ninformation (is it really needed to process the request or not). For me\nit can mean \"don't care\", \"don't know\" or \"not representable\". After all\nfloats support \"NaN\" for the same reason :-)\n\nWilly\n",

Having to place\na specific value to denote emptiness would require specific processing\n(i.e. check for emptiness after removing any item just for the sake of\nreplacing it with the special value).\n\nBy the way, speaking about lists makes me think we may complicate interop\nwhen a header field appears multiple times. For example if we have this\nin a request :\n\n     List: a,b,c,d\n     Foo: bar\n     List: e,f,g,h\n\nIt's not unreasonable to think that some simplified implementations may\nreplace the first occurrence of List with \"none\" after processing it,\nleading to this :\n\n     List: none\n     Foo: bar\n     List: e,f,g,h\n\nOr possibly this :\n\n     List: none\n     Foo: bar\n     List: none\n\nWhich may be processed as \"List: none,e,f,g,h\" or \"List: none,none\"\nrespectively.\n\nJust my two cents,\nWilly\n",

When I pointed out that not all URIs have a host, the response was that clients must send an empty Host field in that situation. It is a MUST requirement in Semantics section 5.4: `If the authority component is missing or undefined for the target URI, then a client MUST send a Host header field with an empty field-value.`\r\n\r\nThis is ingrained in HTTP semantics and commonly used by non-browser HTTP implementations.\r\n\r\n> Regardless, I'd note that many headers address this situation with a reserved value like `none`.

It isn't a good example for anything.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, it would be a bug for an HTTP message processor to drop a received header field just because the value is empty. Nothing about SH will change that. What we are discussing is whether SH is capable of representing an empty list or an empty header field, both of which it is currently incapable of doing.",

I'd further say that removing an element from a\nlist must result in removing the list once the last one was removed as\nit is a set. So I think I'm fine with not dealing with empty lists.\n\nThis then leaves us only with the empty header field alone, likely where\na string or a token are expected. I don't see a reason not to support an\nempty string just like any other string.\n\nA header field is not just a value, it's a name+value combination. With\na void value the name still serves as a boolean (present or not) and\nthis is exactly how it's used when the field is made mandatory to\ndistinguish between agents generations or as a signal to detect support\nfor something.\n\nWe've all filled administrative forms where the requested information\nwas irrelevant but mandatory in the form and just left it void so that\nthe person in charge deals with the particular case (on paper) or\nfilled with whatever was accepted (on web forms) hoping it would just\nbe ignored since irrelevant. For me the Accept and Host fields are\nexactly in this category.\n\nMy concern is to be certain that a valid HTTP request can be transmitted\nover SH. And ironically, the only mandatory HTTP header (\"Host\") is also\nthe one requiring the support for an empty value due to its mandatory\nnature.\n\nWilly\n",

The notion of aesthetics is bizarre,\n> but everyone has different views on that.\n\nWell, to fuel the discussion, I'd say that truncation may happen at the\napplication layer when retrieving the value before decoding it, but it's\njust the same for any other header field or URI or whatever so we don't\nsignificantly improve the situation with this.\n\nAlso some other types are prefixed with a \"?\" and we don't postfix the\nvalue with this character.\n\nWhile initially my intuition made me prefer the star on each side,\nprobably due to aesthetic reasons influencing me, now as a developer\nI'm thinking that having to add special processing in my parsers to\nstop on '*' or '\\0' is probably more code for little value, and that\nthere will unlikely be some specific code to deal with the rare error\nwhere the value is missing the trailing '*', which also means that we\nmay see such occurrences appear in field.\n\nSo in the end I think I'm more in favor of dropping the trailing star\nto limit implementation divergence.\n\nWilly\n",

On top of that, Client Hints opt-in persistence is purged when the user deletes their cookies, and support is disabled when JS is disabled.\r\n\r\nTalking to @martinthomson, it seems like there's another concern around the fact that the hints change when the values does. That seems similar to me to various change events around the exposed values (which do exist for most if not all Client Hints features). Browsers can track CH value changes in similar ways to active fingerprinting vector change events, and treat registration as if the origin accessed the equivalent API and subscribed to receive future events. Similarly, browsers can also mitigate that change reporting in similar ways (e.g. omit the hints or lie about them in some cases).\r\n\r\n@martinthomson & @ekr - Does the above properly captures the concerns you raised? If so, do the mitigations make sense and properly address them?\r\n\r\nIf they do, I'm happy to modify the security & privacy consideration sections to reflect the above",

I'm skimming through this thread with https://github.com/WICG/ua-client-hints/ in mind, as it's something I'd like Chrome to continue pushing forward (also https://github.com/WICG/lang-client-hint/, but that turns out to be a bit more difficult given its usage).\r\n\r\nIn the UA use-case, browsers are broadcasting the value as an HTTP header on every request, which I think we would all agree enables completely passive fingerprinting. The CH infrastructure gives us a path towards requiring sites to affirmatively ask for details above and beyond the brand/version (either via CH or via the JS API), which would make usage visible to mechanisms like OpenWPM and browsers themselves. That seems like a strict improvement over the status quo. Would y'all disagree?\r\n\r\n@ekr: With regard to more traditional hints, I think you're correct to state that forcing information requests through JS APIs currently gives you more insight into the ways in which that information is used by a given application. I think you're also correct to say that CH removes the necessity to ask for a given bit of information on an ongoing basis. This means that fundamentally dual-use APIs will be more difficult to categorize if the work can be pushed to an opaque backend server.\r\n\r\nThat said, it seems likely that this is what we'll end up with in the not-so-distant future, as there are certainly incentives to reduce the number of times information is gathered in a world where it's well-known that those requests feed into a behavioral model for a given page. I talked with @yoavweiss about a model which would require a page to more persistently opt-in. Would a model in which `Accept-CH-Lifetime` would be dropped if the next navigation didn't include the relevant `Accept-CH` header, be interesting? That would give you more or less the same page-level detail about data being explicitly requested.",

      "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nbased on the work we did on https://www.w3.org/Submission/viwi-protocol/ I want to request adding new functionality which can be implemented with two new VERBS and two new headers.\r\n\r\n**Use Case:**\r\nClients want to subscribe to `urls`, as topics with all the filtering, paging information etc. being expressed in the `url`. This would allow services to push information into clients whenever it is considered necessary.\r\n\r\n**Implementation:**\r\nAs subscriptions are a \"convenience\" method compared to polling via `GET`, I propose two new HTTP Verbs\r\n\r\n* SUB for subscription to `url`\r\n* UNSUB for un-subscribing from `url`\r\n\r\nTo control the frequency of updates, we would need additional headers:\r\n\r\n* subscription-interval: <timeStepInMs> \r\n* subscription-updatelimit: <timeStepInMs>\r\n\r\n_Periodic_\r\nThe optional interval attribute specifies the update frequency in milliseconds for periodic updates, while the optional updatelimit attribute specifies the maximum update rate in milliseconds for \u2018on change\u2019 notification. If interval is set, updatelimit is always overruled.\r\n\r\n_On change_\r\nIf interval is not set, the notification interval is defined \u2018on change\u2019 and can be limited by specifying an updatelimit. If an \u2018on change\u2019 occours before updatelimit elapsed, an event will be sent as soon as updatelimit elapsed. If there are multiple changes before the next possible update, only the last one know state is sent after updatelimit elapsed.\r\n\r\n**Summary**\r\nAs this is very close to a regular GET, it would be easy and we could also standardise that per each client-server relation, there would just be a single UDP/IP channel for notifications used and held up. We could also specify that this is a \"simplex\" connection regarding payload data. as clients would use other HTTP verbs to send data. Each data sent from the server to the client would be exactly the same as a GET response. Very straight forward from my perspective and a valuable extension of the standard for all things \"realtime\". \r\n\r\nAll the Headers we replicate in WebSockets today.. puuuffff gone ;) we can just plain HTTP headers... \r\n\r\nThe viwi/RSI spec would than be just rewrote to hold the interface design rules etc. the entire WebSocket parts would be obsolete.\r\n\r\nAlso It would than not be relevant anymore wether we transmit JSON (text) or binary content.. \r\n\r\nThink of it as a GET with multiple responses.. same formats, payloads, everything.. just not req/res but req/res/res/res/res... including all status codes etc.\r\n\r\nRe-Auth would also just be another SUB request with a new Token.. super easy ;)\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of solutions discussed and implemented. As described in the spec I reference to, WebSockets are used, replicating some of the HTTP headers and a topic. \r\n\r\nWith this proposal, I want to reduce friction. - \u00a5 Why setup two sockets, if you can handle it via one?\r\n\r\nThe socket you use for HTTP GET, PUT, POST etc. would have to kept open but could then be used to push information in the other direction.\r\n\r\nThink of a multi-repsonse GET request. Super convenient to work with from developers point of view on both ends of the connection. No extra protocol needed, no extra syntax to learn. Just multiple responses to the same GET request, either on an `on change` or a periodic basis, limited to a certain rate by either the client or the server.\r\n\r\n**Use-case 1 - chat messages**\r\n```\r\nSUB /messages/\r\n```\r\n\r\ninitial response\r\n```\r\n290 OK\r\n```\r\n\r\n1st data response\r\n```\r\n200 OK\r\n[\r\n  \"foo\",\r\n  \"bar\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n2nd data response (100ms later)\r\n```\r\n200 OK\r\n[\r\n  \"foo\",\r\n  \"bar\",\r\n  \"boo\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\netc.",

But I didn't find anything specifically on point, so I'm erring on the side of another issue._\r\n\r\nThe discussion of substructures in https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure-10#appendix-B.2 is somewhat unsatisfying, as it seems there are a number of cases in which a little support for additional structure would be helpful. In particular, allowing the values of dictionary members to be lists would open up a syntax for a few of the policy headers I'm somewhat responsible for that seems difficult to replicate otherwise.\r\n\r\nEven the example in that section:\r\n\r\n> ```\r\n> Example-Thing: name=\"Widget\", cost=89.2, descriptions=\"foo bar\"\r\n> Example-Description: foo; url=\"https://example.net\"; context=123,\r\n>                      bar; url=\"https://example.org\"; context=456\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nimplicitly treats the `descriptions` member as a space-separated list which requires parsing logic above and beyond what structured headers themselves offer. It seems like a very common pattern, and one which would be hard to layer in after the fact in a v2 if we decide that syntax really would be nice.\r\n\r\nI am 100% sure that y'all considered a syntax like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExample-Dictionary-Header: ..., memberName=[thing1, thing2, thing3]\r\n```\r\n\r\n(which, of course, could also be used for [lists of lists](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure-10#section-3.3)). I'm not sure why you rejected it. The discussion in #476 seemed to be about the narrow value of allowing parsing without context. I happen to believe that that's actually valuable, but I also think there's both semantic and aesthetic value in explicitly demarcating lists as a primitive that can exist basically anywhere `sh-item` exists in the current spec.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to send a PR and add tests to https://github.com/httpwg/structured-header-tests/ if you'd accept them, conceptually. :)",

That would make it impossible to have a scalar dictionary value, but perhaps that's a reasonable tradeoff, as it gives consumers a clear contract?\r\n\r\nI worry about backtracking in the case where a given member's value is expected to be a list, but we turn it into a scalar if it happens to have a single item.

List and list of lists would still be separate types (otherwise, everything would be a list of lists).\r\n\r\nI have to say I'm not crazy about either of these; the former for reasons explained (I suspect we could come up with something, but it's going to be awkward), and the latter because then we'll have two different ways to handle inner lists.\r\n\r\nWe could also come up with a Dictionary of Lists type, but that would not fit well with the common use case, which is that some dictionary items will be singular types, others will be lists.\r\n\r\nTo me, the thing we should optimise for here is the data model -- it's going to persist longer than the serialisation, if we do this right.\r\n\r\nSo IME we're back at the start -- we need some sigil in the serialisation that indicates whether a dictionary (and list?) item is an array. \r\n\r\nI proposed using the presence of `;` (with a trailing `;` if the array has only one member). That's not the only way to do it, of course, but it does seem \"natural\" in headers (with the exception of a one member array, which I personally think is acceptable). \r\n\r\nAre there other suggestions? I'd like to ship a new draft by the deadline (Monday), so unless we can resolve this quickly, I'm inclined to ship `;` with a note asking for feedback.",

List of lists is a more limited model, from which you can get to the stricter forms as needed.

On the other hand, if `Proxy-Status` is going to be used primarily as an \"error indicator\", then yes, we might want to migrate this status type and `proxy_internal_response` (#807) elsewhere.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should mandate one or the other?\r\n\r\ncc @ghedo, since he expressed interest in deploying this at Cloudflare.\r\n\r\nOn a separate note, it isn't obvious (to me) what happened from just looking at the status type name, perhaps `http_response_forwarded` would be a bit more descriptive? What do you think?",

To serve this use case, I'm thinking we could use a different header, something like `Proxy-Info`; e.g.,\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nProxy-Info: node=\"fooProxy\", nextHop=\"barOrigin\", latency=525\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nNote that this lets us migrate some of the generic parameters over, because they don't apply to just error responses.\r\n\r\nThat would make your example above:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nProxy-Info: node=\"foocdn\",\r\n            node=\"example.com\",\r\n            node=\"lb-us-west\"\r\nProxy-Status: tls_rejected_proxy_certificate; node=\"lb-us-west\"\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nWDYT? To me this is better, because it's really clear that the status is generated by a proxy. After all, the most common case is going to be normal, non-error operation, which means that we avoid a lot of repeating `http_response_status` to scan through; i.e., it'll look like:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nProxy-Info: node=\"foocdn\",\r\n            node=\"example.com\",\r\n            node=\"lb-us-west\"\r\n~~~",

For this use-case, using a non-crypto hash (e.g., ALDER32) or a crypto hash that has been broken (such as MD5) is (very likely) a bad choice.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are potentially other use-cases for requesting a hash.  One such example is when a file has been transferred and (soon after) the user/client wishes to verify the integrity of the transfer against accidental (i.e. non-malicious) corruption.  In such cases, a non-cryptographically strong algorithm may be acceptable.\r\n\r\nThe other (related) scenario is where the only known-good value for a file's hash was calculated using an algorithm that is either not intended to be crypto-strong (e.g., ADLER32), or using an algorithm that has been compromised (e.g., MD5).  Under these circumstances, the client may wish to know the remote content's hash using such algorithms, as it provides at least some measure of protection.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be something along the lines of ...\r\n\r\n> Servers MAY support non-cryptographically secure hash algorithms.

(see PR for a concrete suggestion).\r\n\r\n> We decided not to support broken crypto algorithms. If you don't need\r\n> crypto quality you can go CRC32c.\r\n\r\nThere's an additional consideration: number of bits.  ADLER32 and CRC32 are both 32-bit algorithms.  When dealing with large volumes of data there's an increased risk of non-malicious corruption that (by chance) a 32-bit algorithm fails to detect.  There is some interest in using MD5 not for its (broken) cryptographic behaviour, but simply because a hash has 128-bits.",

Another benefit would be future-proofing headers that might need to elaborate on their list items in the future; they can just add new parameters as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe downsides I can see:\r\n* As per discussion in #797, it's no longer simple to map lists to a simple programming language data type, nor to simple JSON. However, I think I could adjust the JSON in the test suite to give us the expressiveness we need here, and I think the wrapper object here is pretty self-explanatory.\r\n* It would require current specs using Parameterised List to re-specify using List. Not a big deal, I think, but worth checking with folks like @mikewest.\r\n* A header that wants any list item to fail parsing if it contains parameters will have to say so explicitly -- but as per above, I think that's the right default.\r\n\r\nWhat do folks think -- worth it?",

It allows the first-party to set client integrity expectations of a separately transferred resource; the expected digest is sent in one message (inside the message payload) and independently the resource is received in a different message. In effect, a client that reads SRI sets expectations on itself, with possibly some belief that the first party is more trustworthy than the third party. But of course, SRI can be used to load from first or third party.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Digest is coupled to the message related to its representation. The sender informs the receiver of its integrity expectations i.e. \"As best I can tell, this representation should have this hash\". By combining Digest with Signature this can sort of be turned into \"The signature party thinks the representation should have this hash\".\r\n\r\nBecause SRI is carried in message payload, Digest can be used to protect the integrity of the integrity-check.\r\n\r\nI think the correct way to square the circle of relationship between the two is to say that endpoints that implement these features should apply their requirements. And that when both SRI and Digest are supported, it makes sense to check Digest first. Why? Because digest can protect the transfer of a representation over multiple ranges, different paths and different content-encodings. Only after an endpoint has assurance that the composed representation has integrity within it's own self-defined terms should it then apply the integrity expectations set by a separate SRI party.\r\n\r\nThis means that Digest checks could pass but SRI could fail. I think that's fine. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

To be \"liberal in what you send\" exposes  the sender to the following behaviors:\r\n\r\n* if the recipient is a server:\r\n\r\n1- ignore validation or\r\n2- reply with eg. a `400` + `Want-Digest`\r\n\r\n* if the recipient is a client that does not send a `Want-Digest`:\r\n\r\n1- you will never know, maybe the client will re-issue the request\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes this sound reasonable to you?

This is probably a very good story for extensibility, if we document it right.\r\n\r\nThe only downside that I see is that implementations will no longer map \"simple\" types (e.g., integers, strings) to their analogies in-language; it'll all need to be objects, to accommodate parameters.\r\n\r\nI think that's acceptable -- especially given the token/string schism -- but wanted to make sure everyone understood this. \r\n\r\nFor the test suite, it means that the JSON representation of an item will probably be something like:\r\n\r\n~~~ json\r\n{\r\n  \"value\": 12335,\r\n  \"parameters\": {\r\n    \"foo\": 456.78\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nand with an inner-list:\r\n\r\n~~~ json\r\n{\r\n  \"value\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": \"a\",\r\n      \"parameters\": {\r\n        \"foo\": true\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": \"b\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"parameters\": {\r\n    \"foo\": \"bar\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThis is _verbose_, but fairly straightforward. And of course APIs can make this a lot easier with various methods (e.g., `getParameters` and the like).\r\n\r\nWhat do people think? This is not a small change, so I'm likely to do it in an isolated draft version. There aren't *that* many implementations yet, so if we're going to do this, now is the time.",

Mixing different types of headers in one message is definitely on the table for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nOur API currently exposes a `message` object that has a  `headers` member. `headers` currently has `getHeader` and `setHeader` to manipulate header fields by name.\r\n\r\nTo incorporate SH, our API needs to add some new methods to `headers`; let's say `getDict`, `getList` and `getItem`, along with the corresponding `set*` functions. \r\n\r\nEach one is passed a field name; the `set*` ones are also passed a value to set.\r\n\r\nIn this design, the API itself does *not* need to know the difference between them; it's up to the caller to decide when it's appropriate to call a given function. They can *always* call the \"normal\" functions (`getHeader` and `setHeader`) if they want to work with the strings, but if a header is defined as a SH, they'll be wanting to call the other ones.\r\n\r\nI _think_ you're asking what happens when an API has some append semantics; e.g., `addHeader`. A pathological user might call `setDict` and then `addHeader`, and I agree that there are some choices to be made here. The sane thing to do, I think, would be to specify that `setDict` blows away any existing value.\r\n\r\nIs that what you're talking about, or is it something else?",

I'm not trying to be obtuse, I'm trying to understand what you want the spec to say.\r\n\r\nIt currently says nothing about multiple 'instances' of the same header field.  I believe that's because [RFC 7230, Section 3.2.2](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7230.html#rfc.section.3.2.2) says:\r\n\r\n> A sender MUST NOT generate multiple header fields with the same field name in a message unless either the entire field value for that header field is defined as a comma-separated list [i.e., #(values)] or the header field is a well-known exception (as noted below).\r\n\r\nIt's a normative reference, so it applies to SH.  It means that you can generate multiple instances of a SH header field as long as the value is a sh-list or sh-dictionary.\r\n\r\nset-cookie is the one known exception called out in RFC 7230 which has can appear multiple times but can't be combined.  It explicitly calls out that \"it cannot be combined into a single field-value,\" so it violates [this from SH](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure.html#rfc.section.4.2):\r\n\r\n> When generating input_bytes, parsers MUST combine all instances of the target header field into one comma-separated field-value, as per [RFC7230], Section 3.2.2; this assures that the header is processed correctly.\r\n\r\nSo set-cookie can not be SH.  If an endpoint knows enough about set-cookie to know that it can't get automatically combined, it by default also knows that set-cookie isn't SH.\r\n\r\nWhat would you like it to say further than that?",

A natural way to do this in JavaScript would be to treat both as a JavaScript string and depending on the content serialize as one or the other. However, this would mean that if something takes a String that could also be represented as a Token, it gets a Token. And unless consumers are always required to support that, there's a problem.\r\n\r\nAn alternative here is that we do something less ergonomic, but that'll likely end up favoring one of these over the other.\r\n\r\n(Depending on the outcome of #907 for the getter side we might need a wrapper Item object of sorts that could indicate whether something is a string or token and you could use the same on the setter side, but passing a string when setting should probably work as well.)",

The current specification (-03) makes this difficult because all unknown values as parsed as \u201cNone\u201d (or \u201cLax\u201d after [draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-00](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-00#section-3))\r\n\r\nIf unknown values were instead ignored, older UAs would fallback onto an earlier declaration, while newer ones would get the new behavior.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a site using FirstPartyStrict could fallback to None, to keep cookies accessible in older browsers, with SameSite=None; SameSite=FirstPartyStrict.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the site may wish to fallback to Strict, preferring the tighter CSRF protection, via SameSite=Strict; SameSite=FirstPartyStrict.\r\n\r\nIf we added, say, a StrictOnOrigin mode which used same-origin instead of same-site, a site might use SameSite=Strict; SameSite=StrictOnOrigin.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the [draft-02](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-02#section-5.3.7) does this, however [draft-03](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-03#section-5.3.7) changed this to unconditionally take the last attribute.

I think it's quite reasonable to ensure that implementations land on a consistent story with regard to garbage values for `SameSite`, but I don't think it's important for us to make room for extension to the currently accepted values.\r\n\r\nI feel like there are reasonable arguments for both Chrome's current behavior and Firefox's current behavior. I don't have a strong reason to pick one or the other. Perhaps it's simplest for Chrome to match Firefox's behavior by simply ignoring cookies that assert `SameSite=garbage`? Is that the outcome you'd prefer, @sbingler?",

That's the -02 behavior, rather than the -03 behavior, which unconditionally takes the last one attribute (so no falling back to a previous one) and *then* ignores unrecognized ones.\r\n\r\nI believe Chrome and Safari (as of 10.15) implement the -03 behavior, while Firefox implements the -02 behavior. If we were trying to extend `SameSite`, I think the -02 behavior would be ideal because it gives the developer full control over the fallback chain. That would requiring changing Chrome as well as the macOS/iOS cookie logic again. Failing that, leaving rfc6252bis alone but changing cookie-incrementalism to treat `SameSite=garbage` as `SameSite=None` rather than the default would cover the most likely desired fallback when trying to extend `SameSite`.\r\n\r\nThat said, I agree with you that we probably shouldn't try to extend `SameSite` anymore, so trying to optimize for that is not terribly important.\r\n\r\nWhatever happens, at least one of Chrome+Safari or Firefox should change because they do not behave the same. As things currently stand, it's Firefox that's out of date, since they implement the -02 behavior rather than the -03 behavior.",

      "body": "A European Union (EU) [directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(European_Union)) requires member states to achieve a result, without dictating specific means. In contrast, EU [regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPrivacy_Regulation_(European_Union)) are binding law in all member states. Recital 25 of the Preamble and Article 5(3) of the [ePrivacy Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_and_Electronic_Communications_Directive_2002) (ePD)--often referred to as the EU Cookie Law--regulate the use of cookies. The [ePrivacy Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPrivacy_Regulation_(European_Union)) (ePR) is expected to repeal and replace the ePD in 2019, but it's expected the ePR will regulate the use of cookies in substantially the same manner as the ePD.\r\n\r\nTo paraphrase [one summary](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/5525-cookies-gdpr-requirements), the EU Cookie Law requires the following:\r\n\r\n- Unless an exempt type of cookie, informed consent, based on explicit affirmative action, before storing a cookie on the user's device.\r\n- Conspicuously providing the option for obtaining informed consent.\r\n- A means for withdrawal of consent.\r\n- Ability to prove consent occurred, even if subsequently withdrawn.\r\n- A guarantee, via prior blocking, no tracking performed before consent.\r\n- Informing users of the use of third-party cookies.\r\n- Stating the category and purpose of third-party cookies, even if not listed individually.\r\n- Linking to relevant third-party privacy/cookie policies.\r\n\r\n[RFC 6265](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6265) doesn't include mechanisms enabling user agents to aid in compliance with the above requirements, and this has resulted in presentation of inconsistently placed, and inconsistently formatted, cookie banners worldwide. Such inconsistency degrades user experience, works against conspicuousness, and is annoying to the point that some have attempted to create [workarounds](https://cookiesok.com/) to address the lack of desired user agent functionality. Internet Draft (I-D) [draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis/) proposes to obsolete RFC 6265; however, it also fails to address the issues raised above.\r\n\r\nAttributes, such as the following, could be added to the Set-Cookie Header:\r\n\r\n- Category (Allows grouping for purpose of category consent.)\r\n- Purpose (Provides information to ensure consent is informed.)\r\n- Exempt (Informs user agent not to prompt for consent.)\r\n- Third-Party (Informs user agent to label cookie as third-party.)\r\n- Policy (Allows linking to third-party privacy/cookie policy.)\r\n\r\nEach user agent could then prompt users for consent in a consistent manner across all servers that implement the standard. Consent could be requested individually, for all cookies all at the same time, or selectively (depending on capabilities of the user agent.)\r\n\r\nIf permissible, such attributes may eventually enable user agents to allow users to provide advance consent, via settings, for selected categories of cookies, for selected purposes, on selected domains. A list of allowable categories and purposes may also need to be standardized before anything other than the ability to accept all cookies for selected domains would be feasible.\r\n\r\nDue to the requirement that servers be able to prove consent occurred, user agents would need to be required to provide a response to that effect, and servers would need to be able to reliably assume requested cookies were not stored if no such response is received. Servers would need a mechanism to ensure older user agents don't automatically store the cookies without prompting for consent, as the existing Set-Cookie Header would be used.\r\n\r\nI'm not yet sure what withdrawal of consent might look like.",

          "body": "Hi Timothy,\r\n\r\nThanks for writing that up (and welcome to the group). Personally, I agree very much and have been talking to some folks about doing something like this as an extension to cookies. \r\n\r\nHowever, while there is an emerging set of values that are commonly used on sites -- which is great -- they won't be effective unless they're closely tied into the relevant legislation, and that means a fair amount of work, and engagement with all of the relevant parties.\r\n\r\nPrevious experience (e.g., P3P, DNT) has shown that doing so takes a considerable amount of time, and has a non-trivial amount of associated risk. Getting buy-in to this approach from the legislative bodies / regulators beforehand can lend considerable weight (which was lacking in both of those examples), so personally my focus is on educating those folks that this is possible, before actually specifying it.\r\n\r\nBeyond all that, the scope of work for 6265bis was pretty tightly constrained when we started it; we nominated a set of drafts (linked to [here](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions#rfc6265bis)) that were to be included, along with various errata and bug fixes. As such, this is out of scope for this draft. \r\n\r\nOn top of that, we've been having trouble meeting those more modest goals, and I'm concerned that adding a significant new feature like this would put the document's delivery at yet more risk.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm closing this issue as out of scope for _this_ draft. That doesn't mean we might not try to tackle it in a different document, under the right conditions. \r\n\r\nThanks for raising it.",

This is about whether `x == Serialize(Parse(x))` should always be true)\r\n\r\nIEEE 754 guarantees that if a string with no more than 15 digits is converted to a double and then back to a string, it should result in the original string, but that appears to require rounding in some cases; truncation, which the serialization algorithm calls for, can change the string representation.\r\n\r\nParsing the string \"12345678901234.1\" as a float, for instance, results in a binary64 representation with value 0x42a674e79c5fe433, whose exact decimal expansion is 12345678901234.099609375. Following the text of the serialization algorithm, `fractional_digits_avail` will be 1, and so the number will be serialized as \"12345678901234.0\"\r\n\r\nIt appears, as an implementer, that the only way to ensure that a float parsed from a valid string can be serialized back to the original string is to store it as a fixed point decimal in two parts, or else use a float with >64 bits of precision for storage.",

The use cases have ranged from group chat to chained digital signatures to performance metrics to long download checkpoints to a heck of a lot of other things that I pretend to no longer remember for sanity purposes.\r\n\r\nFixing that in HTTP/1.1 was only possible within chunked extensions. For a variety of reasons that had nothing to do with the use cases, chunked extensions didn't work well over intermediaries and the chicken never hatched. Nevertheless, they did work over HTTP/1.1 when the applications had control over both sides of a connection. I vaguely recall such metadata being present in HTTPng as well.\r\n\r\nI would like for HTTP/2 to have a mechanism for communicating metadata (like trailers) in mid-stream, both for requests (e.g., priority) and responses (e.g., chained sigs).\r\n\r\nI believe that this can be done with an extension frame type that carries trailer data, just like HEADERS, but that doesn't imply the end of DATA. However, I don't really have an opinion on what is the right way to do this in HTTP/2. I'd appreciate if people more familiar with HTTP/2 extensions could choose the best specific syntax.\r\n\r\nThis is not a semantics change for HTTP because the fields are just optional trailers that arrive early. A recipient that is not prepared to handle these fields, for whatever reason, can discard them in the same way as trailers, as specified in http-core [Semantics](/httpwg/http-core/draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics-latest.html).\r\n\r\nRelated to quicwg/base-drafts#3265",

The current version goes too far in my opinion.  I see the following use cases:\r\n\r\n1. Developer of site using the header interactively for debugging\r\n2. Developers' CI tools asserting expected behaviours against the header for smoke testing\r\n3. Developers monitoring their CDN partner's cache efficacy (via RUM, I guess, ideally)\r\n4. Cache operators optimising their behaviour based on a better understanding of upstream cache status\r\n5. Researchers wanting to understand the state of the web more generally\r\n\r\nMany of these use cases arguably call for the most granular and detailed possible information to be included, but I would argue that 95% of the value of this type of header is use case 1.  And in the latest revision, we have lost a simple, clear status token.\r\n\r\nI'd propose reintroducing an enum of statuses, and support the additional params as enrichment. So a complexish example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCache-Status: MISS; cache=fastly-bwi-1234; collapse-hit=?1,\r\n              HIT_FRESH; cache=akamai; res-fresh=289\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current proposal already has a keyless param, for the cache name.  I'm essentially proposing that we add a key to that param, and introduce a new keyless param, for the summary cache status.\r\n\r\nThe result is that this is MUCH easier for developers to scan, a minimal implementation is more immediately useful (because as a cache you need only implement the keyless status param, not any of the others) and therefore implementation/adoption could be faster.  A minmal example could be (exactly as per the earlier spec draft):\r\n\r\n```\r\nCache-Status: HIT_FRESH\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas the minimal implementation of the current draft would be something like `Cache-Status: ExampleCache` and (at least for use case 1) that's unlikely to tell anyone anything they don't already know.",

          "body": "Thanks for clarifying. We should be mindful of feature creep in this spec, for instance there is a difference in documenting how Digest **is used** today for a use case vs attempting to apply Digest to this use case that is satisfied already by other approaches.\r\n\r\nThat said, a survey of present approaches may be useful to help determine if/what the Digest header specification might chose to mention. So to that end, in the context of Google Cloud Storage, a better link would seem to be https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/resumable-uploads \r\n\r\n> In addition, we recommend that you request an integrity check of the final uploaded object to be sure that it matches the source file. You can do this by calculating the MD5 digest of the source file and adding it to the Content-MD5 request header. Checking the integrity of the uploaded file is particularly important if you are uploading a large file over a long period of time, because there is an increased likelihood of the source file being modified over the course of the upload operation.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, AWS provides guidance such as \r\n https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/data-integrity-s3/\r\n\r\n> To verify the MD5 checksum value of the object during its upload to Amazon S3, use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) command aws s3api put-object and include the --content-md5 option. For the value of --content-md5, enter the base64-encoded MD5 checksum value that you calculated, similar to the following:\r\n> \r\n> aws s3api put-object --bucket awsexamplebucket --key awsexampleobject.txt --body awsexampleobjectpath --content-md5 examplemd5value1234567==\r\n> \r\n> Optionally, if you want to store the MD5 checksum value as metadata (custom HTTP header), you can also add the --metadata option in the command, similar to the following:\r\n> \r\n> aws s3api put-object --bucket awsexamplebucket --key awsexampleobject.txt --body awsexampleobjectpath --content-md5 examplemd5value1234567== --metadata md5checksum=examplemd5value1234567==\r\n> \r\n> If the checksum that Amazon S3 calculates during the upload doesn't match the value that you entered for --content-md5, Amazon S3 won't store the object. Instead, you receive an error message in response.\r\n\r\nThere is also the `tus` protocol which is described as a _\"protocol provides a mechanism for resumable file uploads via HTTP/1.1 (RFC 7230) and HTTP/2 (RFC 7540).\"_. For uploads it says  \r\nhttps://tus.io/protocols/resumable-upload.html#checksum\r\n\r\n> A Client MAY include the Upload-Checksum header in a PATCH request. Once the entire request has been received, the Server MUST verify the uploaded chunk against the provided checksum using the specified algorithm. Depending on the result the Server MAY respond with one of the following status code: 1) 400 Bad Request if the checksum algorithm is not supported by the server, 2) 460 Checksum Mismatch if the checksums mismatch or 3) 204 No Content if the checksums match and the processing of the data succeeded. In the first two cases the uploaded chunk MUST be discarded, and the upload and its offset MUST NOT be updated.\r\n> \r\n> The Server MUST support at least the SHA1 checksum algorithm identified by sha1. The names of the checksum algorithms MUST only consist of ASCII characters with the modification that uppercase characters are excluded.\r\n> \r\n> The Tus-Checksum-Algorithm header MUST be included in the response to an OPTIONS request.\r\n> \r\n> If the hash cannot be calculated at the beginning of the upload, it MAY be included as a trailer. If the Server can handle trailers, this behavior MUST be announced by adding checksum-trailer to the Tus-Extension header. Trailers, also known as trailing headers, are headers which are sent after the request\u2019s body has been transmitted already. Following RFC 7230 they MUST be announced using the Trailer header and are only allowed in chunked transfers.\r\n",

It can never assure complete and correct implementation overall.\r\n\r\nI *think* the interesting thing to grease in SH is parameters, since that's a primary extensibility mechanism, and is (now) uniform across values. Ideally, grease parameters would contain values that frustrate the casual approaches above; e.g., strings with commas in them.\r\n\r\nA couple of options I can see;\r\n\r\n* We could advise / require sending implementations to generate extra parameters sporadically (not super-often, so as to limit bandwidth consumption, but not so rarely that it creates debugging nightmares). To be recognisable as grease to the receiving application, their names would have to have some convention.\r\n\r\n* We could advise / require headers using SH to define their own greasing mechanisms when appropriate. \r\n\r\nI suspect that truly automatic greasing might increase friction against adoption of SH, since some people's reaction will be \"what is this thing doing to my header?!?\".

Either way, it's confusing to write/read the spec, and I suspect some people will use the grease prefix for some purpose because it works (most of the time).\r\n\r\nStepping back, I think the scenario we're talking about is the possibility that a consumer of a specific SH header (i.e., post-parse) is likely to erroneously reject headers that has unrecognised parameters, even when the header allows them (keeping in mind that some header definitions might disallow them, even though that's not a great extensibility strategy).\r\n\r\nTo me, that's not the purpose of greasing, because there are lots of other possible erroneous constraints that a consumer (rather than an SH implementation) might put on a header, and we don't try to prevent that. If someone wants to purposefully reject something in a way that's contrary to the header's spec, they're going to do it.\r\n\r\nRather, greasing (to me) is about making sure that someone who's ignorant of the spec / too lazy to read it doesn't just do the \"natural\" thing and e.g., feed an integer into a parser, or split a string on commas. \r\n\r\nSo, to me adding parameters / dict members and \"disappearing them\" at parse is adequate.

Though, the flip side of that would be that each user (e.g., priority) will have its own greasing scheme.\r\n\r\nThat's the reason why I tend to think that the total cost might become smaller if we recommend:\r\n* SH serializers add members using keys that users would never generate\r\n* require them to be passed through by the SH parser\r\n* so that each user would be required to ignore members using unknown keys\r\n\r\nPS.

      "body": "There has been some debate about the relative utility of frames as a means of prioritizing and reprioritizing requests.  \r\n\r\nFrames are not guaranteed to be end-to-end and don't enjoy the benefits listed in [Section 8.1](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-priority.html#why-use-an-end-to-end-header-field).  An (unlisted) reason is that the API for header fields is better understood and more likely to be available than a new and unspecified API.  HTTP/2 defined the use of frames for reprioritization, but APIs are not widely available, nor are they consistent.\r\n\r\nFrames provide two obvious benefits:\r\n\r\n1. They are scoped to the current connection and so only propagate if the receiving endpoint explicitly propagates them.\r\n\r\n2. They can be sent at any time.  This allows for reprioritization, but the requirement to have them sent after requests are complete means that they can't be sent \"on\" a stream, they have to instead refer to a stream, which complicates the design somewhat.  The proposal to allow trailers at any time helps a little here, but only to the extent that it remains possible to send.  Stream closure is used to terminate request bodies in some cases, making any trailer-based solution limited.\r\n\r\nHowever, frames have shortcomings too:\r\n\r\n1. They are complex.  The encoding of a header field into a frame is suboptimal, but necessary for extensibility and consistency reasons.  And the manner in which they refer to requests (or pushes) makes them more complex to manage than a header field.\r\n\r\n2. They are only scoped to a connection, which means that the extent of propagation can be non-deterministic.  In particular, they depend on the connection supporting the signaling.  This is the flip side of the benefit, and - in my opinion - outweighs it.\r\n\r\n3. The API is far more difficult compared to header fields.\r\n\r\nWe know little enough about the efficacy of prioritization that we should defer the definition of frames absent strong motivation for their efficacy and desirability.  The current document makes a good case for header fields, but the motivation for frames is weaker.  It is true that cases like escalation of a speculative fetch to blocking status are *theoretically* appealing, but those cases are rare and unlikely to benefit from reprioritization.  In particular, the mismatch between end-to-end and hop-by-hop (excuse the use of deprecated terminology) characteristics here makes it very hard to reason about the outcome.\r\n\r\nI know that others (@RyanAtGoogle in particular) have questions about the header field from a different angle and would prefer frames, exclusively.  So this probably comes down to having more discussion about which approach to take: headers, frames, or both.  \r\n\r\nIn either case, I would suggest that we have a need for both clear signals that the mechanism is broadly useful and evidence that that it is likely to be widely implemented.\r\n",

And the manner in which they refer to requests (or pushes) makes them more complex to manage than a header field.\r\n\r\nCan you expand on what you mean by \"complex\"? Parsing strings is more difficult and error-prone than parsing fixed-width binary fields. I think you might be concerned about ordering problems w.r.t. other frames for the same stream, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\n> 2. They are only scoped to a connection, which means that the extent of propagation can be non-deterministic. In particular, they depend on the connection supporting the signaling. This is the flip side of the benefit, and - in my opinion - outweighs it.\r\n\r\nFunny you wrote that, because I have the exact opposite opinion.\r\n\r\nPriority is a relative concept. We must have some way to group requests before we can speak meaningfully about the priority of any individual request. This proposal does not define an explicit grouping of requests -- the grouping is implicitly per connection. Whether we communicate priorities with a header or a frame does not change this fact. It follows that this proposal defines hop-by-hop priorities. We can claim they are \"end-to-end\" but that is a lie. The proposal admits as much when it refers to proxies needing to [coalesce](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-priority.html#coalescing-intermediaries) priorities before they are forwarded to backends.\r\n\r\nI can imagine true end-to-end priorities. One strawman proposal is to say that priorities are global: if client A sends a request with level=low, and client B sends a request with level=high, then B's request is always preferred. This is a bad idea for [obvious reasons](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-priority.html#fairness).\r\n\r\nAnother strawman is to add a `uuid` field to each priority. Each client might generate a `uuid` and send that same value with each request. Now a proxy can blindly forward priorities to backends -- given sufficiently random uuids, there is no fear of collisions and the backend implementation is straightforward. But I think this is a bad idea for privacy reasons, if nothing else.\r\n\r\nConnections are the only available grouping mechanism I can think of.\r\n\r\nRelatedly, if we are using an \"end-to-end\" HTTP header field, then I expect that the header field should have some meaning on HTTP/1. But I'm not sure what that meaning is ... it hasn't been specified, and I'm not sure if any meaningful behavior is possible?\r\n\r\n> 3. The API is far more difficult compared to header fields.\r\n\r\nDon't agree. Reprioritization is not possible with header fields (barring a hacky repurposing of trailers, as I think you suggested), so a frame-based API is strictly more powerful.\r\n\r\nHTTP libraries typically have a type that manages information about the request, beyond just the request headers. This type is a perfectly reasonable place to put priority information. JS has [RequestInfo and RequestInit](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-method), Go has [http.Request](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request), Python has [urllib.Request](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#request-objects), etc. I don't see how frames make APIs \"far more difficult\"? Perhaps you had a different notion of \"API\" in mind?",

Indeed, I do have questions about header fields. After reading @tombergan's reply, I think we're both on the same page.\r\n\r\n1. Since reprioritization is not possible with a header it seems that frames are more powerful than headers and frames (or some other non-header mechanism at least) would be required. I'd much prefer to have only one mechanism for expression priorities.\r\n\r\n2. The end-to-end-ness of headers strikes me as a con, rather than a pro. Proxies which send requests from multiple clients over the same back-end connection and pass along the original client's priority header run the risk of creating pathological behavior. A client with only a single low priority request outstanding could end up indefinitely starved by another client issuing high priority requests. Starvation of requests is a feature when a single client's low priority requests are intentionally starved by the same client's high priority requests. Starvation of requests is a bug when one client unintentionally starves another client.\r\n\r\nIt feels like any such proxies need to make a conscious decision about how to prioritize such requests. Using a hop-by-hop mechanism makes this required. Frames are obviously hop-by-hop and they seem ideally suited here. (If we felt really passionate that headers are the right approach then perhaps a pseudo-header would be an option. But frames seem simpler in this case).\r\n\r\n3. On the API front, it's not obvious to me that headers are a simpler API than the existing APIs exposed by HTTP libraries (as @tombergan said). However, if it turned out there was a library in which headers really were a simpler API, there's nothing to prevent that library from transforming a caller's header into the protocol's frame.",

Would a simpler priority scheme make it people more inclined to take this up?\r\n\r\nIn contrast, everything I'm familiar with has methods to set or get headers with a K-V. Handling headers is a common activity, so the code is probably battle tested, more familiar to developers, and easily migrates between implemention environments and language. What's more, endpoint applications could experiment today without any needing their libraries to update.

On one handing, simply passing around ascii text which can store information on any prioritization scheme is really convenient and attractive. On the other hand, as something to expose on, for example, Chrome's URLRequest object it's not a great fit. In Chrome at least, requests are typically initiated at a layer that is entirely ignorant of the underlying connection that will be used to satisfy the request. (Many requests result in a new connection being created, for example). As such, the caller does not know if it's going to be HTTP/1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, HTTP/3+priority extension X, etc. This means that the caller is not in a great position to know what underlying prioritization scheme will be used on the wire. As a result, the API that we want to expose on the request needs to be relatively generic. (HTTP/2 stream dependencies is the opposite extreme :>) Further,  along the way from the Request to the connection there are various throttles and internal prioritization decisions which take the Request's priority into consideration. As such it's important at this code be able to understand priority and a free-from priority string is problematic in this respect.\r\n\r\nAll of this being said, I think the issue of API design should be largely orthogonal from the on-the-wire prioritization encoding and I wonder if we (HTTP and QUIC WGs) would be well served to focus on the protocol and not the API?

Would a simpler priority scheme make it people more inclined to take this up?\r\n\r\nThese are good questions. My attempt at answers:\r\n\r\nBrowsers use 10s to 100s of HTTP requests to render a complex document with many parts and dependencies, often for users over slow networks, making prioritization important. That might be a special case. Outside of browser land, I suspect that most programs fetch no more than one or a few URLs at a time and wouldn't benefit from priorities. (I don't have any evidence for this, it's just a suspicion.)\r\n\r\nOne exception is RPC-over-HTTP, such as gRPC.

These fields are defined to be application-specific and are not interpreted by gRPC. Our new Priority header field does not match the `grpc-*` pattern that is reserved for gRPC use, so it's not clear that gRPC could use our Priority header in the first place, as it might conflict with existing app-specific metadata.\r\n\r\nThere has been interest in exposing priorities to JavaScript.

I agree that we can only realistically use priority information if they share a common reference point.  Priority signals from different sources are unlikely to share a reference frame (which is another reason that [merging](#1026) is probably a bad idea - servers might not share the frame the client uses).  However, we have a number of ways in which we might determine that two requests share a common reference frame.\r\n\r\nConnections are probably the obvious way to tie requests together, but they fall short in a few ways.  The coalescing intermediary described in the draft is one.  And then we have HTTP/1.1, as you say.\r\n\r\nThe use of IP- and transport-layer fields to correlate requests is similarly fraught, but I'll bet that it happens already, so I wouldn't rule it out completely.  Weaknesses due to competition of incompatible endpoints behind a NAT are probably rare enough (outside large-scale NAT) that you could deploy something that used source IP with moderate confidence that it wouldn't do significant harm.  The [X-]Forwarded-For fields are still useful at origin servers that are fronted by an intermediary.\r\n\r\nBut the obvious grouping construct here is cookies.  As much as we despise them, they are almost perfect for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that HTTP/1.1 requests could use priority using the above, though I suspect that the implementation challenges are such that we won't see it happen.  If you had a server with multiple HTTP/1.1 connections to it from the same source, it could implement shared prioritization and congestion control for that set of connections.  You might say that HTTP/2 is probably a good idea at that point and you'd be right, but I've seen stranger things.\r\n\r\n@RyanAtGoogle \r\n> This means that the caller is not in a great position to know what underlying prioritization scheme will be used on the wire.

It avoids creating any strong linkage between the API and the eventual connection.  We know that they get through, even if they might not be acted upon in precisely the same way.  Have you considered continuing to respect `URLRequest.setHeader(\"priority\", \"5\")` or similar as a method for reprioritization?  If frames aren't available, then it does nothing, but you can feed that through the pipeline as you choose from there.  That includes adjusting the value based on local policy.",

You could go object-oriented, and pass a request object to another request's method to establish a relationship.  Or you could pass IDs around for the same effect in a more declarative style.

          "body": "@martinthomson I don't think it's possible to conclude that the old prioritization scheme wasn't widely used because it was a frame.  The main reason I've heard cited for why it wasn't widely used was excess complexity for implementers and for developers who used it.  If the scheme had been simpler, I believe APIs would be widespread by now.\r\n\r\nAbove, you talk about using priorities across multiple HTTP 1.1 connections and how it might work.  For every load balancer setup I've ever heard of, that would be somewhere between impractical and impossible.  Either way, I can't imagine anyone doing this.  Cookies are a particularly bad example, because they are visible long after the connection has been load-balanced.\r\n\r\nAlso, the frame solves a problem besides re-prioritization, which is how to convey a hop-by-hop signal when a header indicates an E2E signal, such as on a multiplexed connection behind a load balancer.\r\n\r\nSome points that came out of the design team that are still important:\r\n1) Re-prioritization is used today and was believed to be useful.  I realize you're questioning that here, but it seems like your real goal is to get rid of the frame.\r\n2) The design team decided that the header should not be exposed directly to Javascript, at least not without the agreement of the W3C that was the right thing to do, so it's not as simple as making it  a header and the API is done.\r\n3) It was pretty clear consensus would never be obtained on a single option(header or frame), due to the varied set of use cases.\r\n\r\nMy personal opinion is that the header is primarily useful for server infrastructure to fix poor or non-existent client prioritization, which is the use case Cloudflare was successful with.  I've seen no evidence the header has any advantages over the frame in the browser use case, and it does introduce complexity, since now my multi-tier load balancer infrastructure needs to do special case handling for a new header based on whether it's directly user-facing.  Realistically, stripping it may be the safest option for load balancers.",

There are plenty of aspects in the overall design that you might point to, and I'm happy to concede that being a frame is probably the least problematic.\r\n\r\nI didn't mean to suggest that cross-connection prioritization was something you might expect to have implemented - at least at the server end.  But browsers might be in a better position to do something.\r\n\r\nAddressing your points in order.\r\n\r\n1. Yes, I think that the frame is insufficiently motivated.  Both as a HBH signal and for reprioritization.  I think that the HBH aspects are insufficiently strong to motivate its inclusion, though I'm happy to put forth my reasons for why I think a field is superior in that case also.  It honestly sounds like you have some proprietary use cases, for which I think that this discussion isn't likely going to be informative.\r\n\r\n2. I don't understand this conclusion.  And I disagree with it.  I realize that the implications of allowing untrusted script to determine what is essentially policy on browser prioritization logic seem scary, but we let content to do a whole lot more than that.  I personally have no issue with allowing content to set priority.  After all, the effect on performance is something that a site ultimately answers for.\r\n\r\nAre you suggesting that you can't or wont access a header field?",

The Priority header field provides information about what the User Agent thinks of priority.  This might be adjusted by intermediaries on the path, and it might not be globally consistent, but that does not mean the information should be discarded.

If these semantics are to carry any weight, then it needs to be really clear what the client might expect a server to do with each different value.

Priority 0 gets completed first, and 7 last.\r\n\r\nThe idea that different clients might share an understanding of different values is nice, but for that to work you need to trust that clients will label things similarly.  Right now, I don't see any incentive to do so.  If one implementation were to shift their priorities one higher or one lower, the effect probably wouldn't be any different.\r\n\r\nI do strongly agree with the idea that the number of buckets needs to be small.  8 is a reasonable number on balance.

It's not necessary to spec anything beyond that.\r\n\r\nFurther, I think the specific proposal is a mistake at a technical level. Expanding on that:\r\n\r\nIIUC, the design is largely motivated by the work behind [this blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/better-http-2-prioritization-for-a-faster-web/), which argues that current browsers either don't use H2 priorities or use suboptimal priorities, therefore CloudFlare gets benefit from server-driven priorities. But as that blog post observes, Chrome's priorities are almost optimal. The only problem is that images are serialized, rather than concurrent, and this happens because H2 does not allow constructing the optimal schedule with concurrent images. This is fixed by the new priority scheme. I fully expect that Chrome and other browsers will use the optimal schedule for H3 ... at which point, what is the server going to do?\r\n\r\nHere's a more concrete problem. Suppose a web site uses the same image in two contexts: as the main image of an article, and as a thumbnail image in a list of related articles. In the first context, the image is prominently above-the-fold and should have high priority. In the second context, the image is below the main content and should have low priority. The browser knows this and can prioritize the image accordingly. But how will the server know this? The server sees one request at a time. Given a request for the image, in isolation, it cannot distinguish these two cases.\r\n\r\nThere are other examples like this, such a script that is sync in one context and async/defer in another context, or a stylesheet that is used by the main frame in one context and an iframe in another context. In general, it appears that the client has strictly more information than the server and thus can do a strictly better job generating priorities.\r\n\r\nMixing client and server-generated priorities might be a good idea, but it appears to be a research problem. IMO, even setting aside Martin's concern, this idea is not mature enough to be accepted by this working group.",

          "body": "I think there are two aspects to Martin's issue:\r\n\r\n1) the use of prose that says _override_ rather than _maybe prefer server priorities_. I think that can be straightforwardly addressed by expanding the description of priority collaboration\r\n\r\n2) reservation of [supplementary](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-priority.html#rfc.section.3.1.3) levels for use only by the server. Although a gateway can use the information as it sees fit, the specification gives more leverage to the server. Is that ok?\r\n\r\n@tombergan thanks for the examples. Similar edge cases have come up in design team discussions. Some possible ways to address these are:\r\n\r\n* consider that a server delivering resources can combine `priority` with other client information. For example, [Fetch Metadata](https://www.w3.org/TR/fetch-metadata/) (which is just a proposal at this stage) defines [sec-fetch-dest-header](https://www.w3.org/TR/fetch-metadata/#sec-fetch-dest-header) which would let a server understand if a resource is intended for `document`, `embed`, `nested-document` etc.\r\n\r\n* extend `priority` to carry client information such as `in-viewport/out-of-viewport`, `thumbnail` etc\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we have examples where the server has strictly more information than the client (e.g. progressive images) and can provide information that a gateway can use to improve performance. Writing that as an extension is possible with today's model.\r\n\r\nI think it is important to agree whether the WG believes in keeping the model of collaboration in scope, even if we can't solve all problems in the initial document. Removal of collaboration would push us closer to the HTTP/2 client-only priorities, which has impact on the headers vs frames discussion.",

I agree the client doesn't know how the images are encoded and would have trouble communicating exactly how image bytes should be scheduled. However, I believe the progressive image optimization can be implemented without any cooperation from the client, except that the client should request images with incremental=true. Once the server is given those incremental buckets, all of the progressive image scheduling magic is contained on the server, within those buckets.\r\n\r\nIn the example above, the server would send the entire response for image b before sending any bytes for c or d. (After all, this is what the client asked for.) After sending b, the server would send the image headers for c and d, then the initial previews, then the final bytes.\r\n\r\nWhen I said \"if the information is sent in the HTML or DOM\", I was referring to scheduling decisions like \"image A is more important than image B\". I had assumed that you wanted the server to make decisions like that. I think that's a fine thing to do -- maybe the browser has a difficult time finding above-the-fold images, whereas for some web site, the server knows exactly which images are above-the-fold. My point was: that kind of priority information can be communicated in the HTML, perhaps using markup like `<img priority=high src=x.jpg>` [1]. The client can use this information, however it wants, to generate more optimal priorities.

AFAICT, we don't have evidence that merging client and server priorities is required for optimal performance. We have some intuition that it may be useful in some cases, and that's about it. This reminds me of old H2 conversations in the ietf-http-wg archives, where people expressed an intuition that we needed priority groups or trees to support proxies, so we ended up with trees, but no one ran any large scale tests first to verify that trees were a good idea, and now H2 has a prioritization scheme that no one likes. I would like to avoid making that mistake again.\r\n\r\nI fully support experimentation, but I don't support adding experimental features to this spec. I also support browser-side experimentation, and by using fixed and inflexible semantics for each priority level, this spec potentially limits browser-side experimentation (see #1023).\r\n\r\nI believe it's sufficient to say: there are N urgency levels, of unspecified meaning, that the server is free to ignore client priorities if it chooses. Even with this simple specification, it is possible to test merging client and server priorities.

The server can run any experiment it likes, with the caveat that it may need to adjust the experiment based on User-Agent, which seems reasonable?",

Implementing even that few levels can be interesting, but it is workable.\r\n\r\nDouble that and it probably isn't much worse.  Iterating over 8 queues is workable, for instance.  But multiply too much and you will have to find ways to reduce it to something you can manage.  Once everyone has performed similar (but likely different) reductions, the additional bits you spent on signaling aren't helping.\r\n\r\nObviously, any expectation we might have about consistent treatment from servers is a fantasy.  Once we allow for the server to have any input, we leave this open to non-determinism.  But the advantage of a header field is that you see what contributed to that.

It's good to know that we are converging on 8 urgency levels (or something minimum).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I still think that we should have semantics, and that we should allow servers to merge priorities.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/1023#issuecomment-574968655, @martinthomson has laid down the reasons why he does not favor that. Quote:\r\n> For that to work reliably, you would have to eliminate any freedom that browsers might exercise in terms of using different priority markings on requests. I'm not comfortable saying that. That's the other part of the semantic thing. I can understand 5>3, but as soon as we get to saying that all browsers need to mark image loads as X, then we lose the ability to apply a different strategy.\r\n\r\nI do not fully agree with the observation, and I disagree with the rationale.\r\n\r\nMy observation is that, as stated in https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/1023#issuecomment-574974419, status quo provides enough freedom to the clients. We have three supplementary levels that can be utilized. We also allow the client to promote (or demote) urgency between prerequisite / document / supplementary / background. While it is true that having the semantics reduces the amount of freedom the client has, I'd assume that it would be enough.\r\n\r\nBut moreover, I would argue against placing the ability \"to apply a different strategy\" above allowing servers to tweak priorities.\r\n\r\nAs @LPardue points out, multiple servers already tweak priorities because doing so has benefits, and the headache is that it's difficult to do so in a stable and cross-browser manner due to lack of semantics in H2 priorities. It's a real problem. Compared to that, as nice as it would be to provide freedom for applying different strategies, it's just a possibility. That's not a problem that we have now. Based on our experience in H2, I am also doubtful if we would ever come up with something very different for the web browsing case.\r\n\r\nI would very much prefer fixing the issues we have now, rather than prioritizing something that we _might_ do.\r\n",

One is by associating priority to the initiators of the requests (e.g., [priority hints](https://wicg.github.io/priority-hints/)) as you correctly point out, and the other is by sending signal from the server (most likely as a response header). I would not go into the details, but there are pros and cons in these two approaches. That said, for both of these two approaches, it is beneficial to have semantics. Otherwise, you cannot use either of them, unless you specify the priority of all the resources that are used.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, server-sent signal will continue be useful, and for that to be useful, we need semantics.",

          "body": "I talked with @tarunban. Here's a summary:\r\n\r\nIn Chromium, each request is assigned a priority (see Yoav's\u00a0link) which is respected by task schedulers throughout the browser (well, not every task scheduler, but at least conceptually that is the goal). When a request hits the network stack, it gets throttled if it has a relatively \"low\" priority. This is necessary on H1 where there's no response prioritization on the server, but it also happens on H2/H3 for a variety of reasons, such as the fact that pages often load third-party resources over different connections which can't share H2/H3 priorities. On H2, just before the request is sent out, its Chromium priority is [translated to an H2 priority](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/spdy/http2_priority_dependencies.cc). The same happens for H3/QUIC.\r\n\r\nRequests may be reprioritized. For example, when the user scrolls an image into the viewport, that image's priority is increased. When a request's priority changes, we [send](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/spdy/spdy_session.cc?rcl=690392f7ffa2044773cfb7c93d5771e7457c7761&l=1260) an updated H2 PRIORITY frame.\r\n\r\nNote that Section 3 will force browsers to use the same resource priority assignments for all time.\u00a0@tarunban echoed concerns from myself and others that this is a bad idea for browsers over the long term. As Yoav alluded, we are actively investigating new ideas, such as deprioritizing resources in iframes.\r\n\r\n>Is there data on the effectiveness of evolving prioritisation instanciation in a world of servers that vary in priority implementation quality?\r\n\r\nWe have lots of data on prioritization changes generally speaking, but we can't give a concrete answer to this question. We have [data](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=836552#c34)\u00a0which shows that throttling H2 requests at the browser speeds up page loads. While this is likely a sign of poor H2 priority implementations in servers, we can't say how much that contributes. We also have data which shows that H2 priorities have zero effect in the wild due to kernel bufferbloat on the server (even with TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT). Fortunately, bufferbloat is less of a problem with H3/QUIC, where we've seen moderate speedups with priorities -- see \"Experimental measurements\" in [these slides](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/106/materials/slides-106-httpbis-sessa-priorities-00.pdf).",

          "body": "Thanks @kazuho for mentioning our paper. I've many thoughts on this, but not a lot of time atm.\r\n\r\nThe main point to me is that users need -some- way of manipulating browser-set priorities, whether it be on the client end (e.g., priority hints, preload) or at the server side (e.g., the current proposal, Cloudflare).\r\n\r\nBoth options are currently not well supported... I asked @yoavweiss and Dom Farolino earlier about priority hints and, despite being around for years and running origin trials, they haven't been activated nor is it clear if they help (at least not outside of google) (https://twitter.com/domfarolino/status/1221803122638508032?s=20). There is, IIUC, also no indication from other browsers to support this (to which I would like to note that a lot of this current discussion is highly Google-driven from the browser side). Even then, they would not allow giving a hard priority, but mainly manipulating the browser's estimate. Other options like preload have had their own problems in the past (e.g., https://andydavies.me/blog/2019/02/12/preloading-fonts-and-the-puzzle-of-priorities/, no FF support). \r\n\r\nOn the server-side then, it's notoriously difficult to inject a resource there due to the instable nature of the trees and because all browsers/clients build different trees. The only real option is to sniff the UA (explicitly or implicitly https://twitter.com/patmeenan/status/1222559418434408450?s=20) and have custom behaviour per-browser. This is for example what Cloudflare is doing for their setup and they are (rightly?) keeping it proprietary, since it represents a significant engineering investment to get that to work. This is not something a typical developer can solve using nginx/apache. \r\n\r\nSo, I believe the current approach is motivated by the fact that it's (currently?) difficult to manipulate resources on the browser end, so let's at least make it simple on the server-side. The counter-argument seems to be: but the browsers will get there -eventually- (the references to priority hints, better preload support, etc. ). So it comes down to if you believe that or not. Similarly to how you claim to have seen no proof that server-side re-prioritization works, I have seen no proof that client-side options will become commonplace soon. \r\n\r\nAs such, my opinion would be: we're now in a place to address this problem in a browser-agnostic way, we should do that. If priority hints ends up supported everywhere: great, more flexibility.\r\n\r\nWith regards to not locking browsers into too rigid a structure and allowing experimentation: I would say something about this, but it would devolve into a rant on how things like the \"deprioritizing background tabs\" idea was proposed in 2014 (2013? https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-chan-http2-stream-dependencies-00), influenced the dependency tree complexity, and was subsequently never actually implemented. So I'd rather refrain. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Chromium has an internal notion of priority. This internal notion happens to be similar to what is being proposed for H3, but I believe that's an intentional aspect of H3's design more than anything. Developers can (and do) change how Chromium's internal priorities are assigned without directly thinking about the impact on H2/H3. The translation from internal priority to H2/H3 is a separate concern.\r\n\r\nInternal browser priorities can look completely different. At one time there was a proposal to replace Chromium's priority enum with a dependency\u00a0graph. This never happened (it turns out DAG-based APIs are hard) but it's a natural thing to try, especially as new features like JS modules make the DAG-based nature of page loads more explicit.\r\n\r\n>We've talked about 8 levels as an acceptable compromise for number of priority values.

Look at the history of the code in Yoav's link -- Chrome has used 6 levels for a while, but the assignment of requests to levels has changed over time, i.e., the meaning of \"prerequisite\", \"supplementary\", etc. has changed.\r\n\r\nIn order for this idea to work, you need to guarantee that every browser will generate the exact same set of priorities for a given page load, otherwise the server might be mistaken about what priority level X means and its priority edits will be wrong. You need to define how requests map to priority levels and browsers must agree to implement that mapping. IMO this will never happen. First, recall that browser-internal priorities are separate from H2/H3 priorities. In order to implement fixed priorities for H3, browsers need to either (a) adopt H3 priorities for their internal representation and add \"thou shalt not change this\" comments to the methods that assign priorities to requests, or (b) embed enough information into their internal priorities so the net stack can translate to the appropriate H3 priority (in practice the amount of information needed might be large). Note that both options impose implementation constraints across the _entire browser_, not just the H3 stack.\r\n\r\nSecond, we have at least three main browsers to deal with: Chromium (and Edgium, etc), Firefox, and Safari. I don't know how Firefox's internal priorities work exactly, but you can see from [this enum](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/__GENERATED__/dist/include/nsIClassOfService.h#42) that it's not a simple list of 6 levels ([this older figure](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8FvJQaAD1uE/VK2cQKI9I3I/AAAAAAAASk4/SdE5MoBqQ_8/s1600/IMG_20150107_144530.jpg) suggests 5 levels). I don't know what Safari does either. It's based on WebKit, so it probably uses 6 levels like Chromium, but I'm sure it uses those levels differently from Chromium. How will you convince\u00a0browsers to agree on the same implementation?\r\n\r\nThird, what happens when a new web feature adds a new flavor of request? Do we need a process for browsers to agree on how to prioritize these new requests?\r\n\r\nFourth, recall that the true dependencies form a DAG. The flattening of a DAG into N levels is a heuristic. Like any other heuristic, it might be wrong. It seems short-sighted to enshrine this heuristic into browsers for all time.\r\n\r\nFifth, HTTP is not a browser-only protocol. All of these problems can reappear in non-browser contexts.\r\n\r\n>@rmarx: Similarly to how you claim to have seen no proof that server-side re-prioritization works\r\n\r\nI think you have misunderstood my comments. This is what I asked:\r\n\r\n>Can you share a link to a study showing that (a) server-driven prioritization will be useful with this new priority spec, and (b) server priorities will need to be merged with client priorities as described in this proposed spec?\r\n\r\nI want to see evidence of both (a) and (b) together. I already believe servers can have more knowledge than clients in some situations. See [Klotski](https://www.usenix.org/node/189011), [Polaris](https://www.usenix.org/node/194917), and other academic work. All of this work has a similar flavor: the server takes over the entire loading process for a page and ignores what the browser would have done. [My suggested edits to the spec](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/1026#issuecomment-577465626) are sufficient to support this use case.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is different: it wants browsers to set priorities in a fixed way so that servers can edit priorities of individual requests. I believe this is a bad idea because [servers don't have enough context for individual requests](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/1026#issuecomment-572419307) and because getting all browsers to agree on how to set priorities is not going to work (see above).\r\n\r\nAFAICT, neither of @kazuho's citations address my\u00a0question. I addressed progressive images in an [earlier comment](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/1026#issuecomment-572757365) -- I don't see why merging of client and server priorities is necessary to implement progressive image optimizations. I haven't had a chance to read [Robin's paper](https://h3.edm.uhasselt.be/files/HTTP3_Prioritization_extended_3jul2019.pdf) in detail, however, it doesn't seem to be evaluating client/server priority merging; it's evaluating either different priority schemes a browser could use, or something more like Klotski, where the server takes over the entire loading process.",

          "body": "What I find interesting in this thread is that we are debating about the merits of conveying information about the request intent - specific semantics vs more generic levels. Meanwhile the [Fetch Metadata](https://www.w3.org/TR/fetch-metadata/) spec is attempting to introduce an HTTP header-based signal that conveys information about the way a request was made and the context in which it will be usedl; all for the purpose of empowering a server to make decisions on how it handles that request. The conjecture about how to handle new web features applies equally to Fetch Metadata.\r\n\r\nThe proprosed semantic is an approximate model that provides a pretty good analogy of how a client uses resources. Some may disagree with that. A server that understands \"prerequisite\" blocks \"supplementary\" is empowered to make a judgement call on the tradeoffs when it comes to sheduling resources. If we convert that to levels \"0\" and \"1\" with no semantic, then a server can only make a value judgement based on the relative weight.\r\n\r\nChrome's internal mappings are an implementation detail, but the outcome is visible to all and is effectively an opaque API. We saw this with other H2 clients, producing different trees with similar goals. Reverse engineering this is possible but it is fragile - there is no contract, and no interoperability forum and no in-band mechanism to describe the intenr. Servers have unilateral control of priority but effectively have no real way to influence that process. Even if priority information is exposed to a server operator, meaningfully using this is a bit of a crapshoot. So typicall server operators leave things up to the server implmentation to handle everything. However, this leads into benfits for clients; a server with deterministic priority scheduling is a control that allows iterative performance improvent. IIUC one concern is that removal of the control factor could reduce this opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe above works pretty well for a lot of web resources. The counter example we keep coming back to is progressive images. In Cloudflare's work, we have shown that not all bytes of a response have equal priority. We can build a delivery schedule based on a set of priority checkpoints on byte boundaries, which serves different regions at different priorities. We can use the client's indicated priority to align these checkpoints to the relative priority of the resource in the connection context - merging. The schedule is carried in a format that the priority scheduler can consume and enact. There has been a suggestion that priority checkpoints could be passed through to the client somehow, but given that the information is representation-specific I see several barriers and think this would fail to be realized. (Aside: I'm remembering a [recent discussion](https://github.com/w3c/preload/issues/139) about security consideration for ranges that may or may not be a problem here). \r\n\r\nI think controlling server prioritization behaviour from a non-client signal is possible even if the specification doesn't say anything about merging. Having a constrained number of levels certainly helps this case.\r\n\r\nIf I could have my cake and eat it, I would suggest two modes: \r\n* a semantic-oriented model with all levels available to client and server. This works as a best-effort model that is easy for many clients to pick up and run with. \r\n* an opaque mode signalled by a parameter, that lets clients with a case for stronger control to use the levels without any implied semantics.\r\n\r\n",

It's not clear why you can't do this within one priority level. Say the client requests a few images with priority 3. You can push the headers to the front of the queue within priority 3, then the previews, then handle everything else normally. This doesn't strictly follow what the client asked for, but that's fine, you're doing something better, and it doesn't require any cooperation from the client.",

The arguments against the scheme are weighted in favour of allowing complex UAs to have a safe freedom to change aspects of its priority model. External contributors pay a non-trivial cost to try and improve on this model. This to me highlights a problem with the applicability of the draft beyond urgency levels, that the extensible priority scheme will never see additional parameters because they leak abstractions. Leaking like this harms the ability for future change. It may also have security, privacy and fingerprinting concerns.\r\n\r\nMy comments on simplicity reflect less complex UAs.

Can you describe a scenario where they would differentiate between the server doing the right thing vs. the wrong thing?\r\n\r\nThis is a good question given the stage of discussion. Starting with the axiom that the H2 tree allowed a very free form of indicating web priorities. Some server implementers found value in reading meaning into the tree and using that information to experiment. Having that info might not be a strict requirement, but it improves the chances that experiments can operate within some sane bounds. Divining the tree is fragile, and also hard when its empty or broken. \r\n\r\nA simpler scheme negates some of these problems. It reduces the amount of context needed on the server side and avoids issues caused by H3 delivery ordering. However, it also discards some information that was in the tree such as the exclusive priority relationship. This could help indicate that a resource is blocking in some way and tinkering with its importance is probably going to result in a bad time. OTOH adjusting server behaviour to protect or improve the serving of that blocking resource (I.e. schedule I/O reads from disk, use a fast path to upstream) could make things better. Without the signal we'll never know.\r\n\r\nA good example of useful information is the incremental (aka concurrency bit). This information allows a server to make a value judgement on how to time slice. \r\n\r\nThe semantic levels indicate blocking and create some guard rails to say \"if you push a priority outside here, it's probably not going to achieve a good result in the overall page load\". What I'm hearing is that those rails are a hindrance for clients. And just having semantic free levels might be good enough, as long as servers understand which end of the space is high prioirty.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of mights above because actually being inclined to dig in and build software to do this is hard with thebstatis quo.",

Some implementations that don't render images progressively may turn it off for images. Some, which streamingly parse multiple scripts at a time, may turn it on for scripts.

It could be helpful if the server-side logic could promote urgency of such requests, as high as the urgency level of the HTML, or somewhere above that.\r\n* Demoting the urgency of the bytes at the tail of a progressive JPEG image. As previously discussed, in terms of user experience, there is marginal benefit, if any, in providing those bytes at an early point. Therefore, a server might demote them to the same level as asynchronously fetched JavaScript files, or to somewhere even below, but above background downloads.\r\n\r\nIf we are to support these two scenarios, there needs to be a common understanding about where the \"default\" urgency level is (i.e. the urgency level used for fetching the HTML of the main window), and where the \"background\" level is. In case of the first scenario, the server would promote the urgency to the \"document\" level or one above that. In case of the latter, the server would demote the urgency to the level right above \"background.\"\r\n\r\nThen, we considered if we could support these scenarios at the same time minimizing the restriction to be imposed to the client-side. The rough consensus was that having a common understanding of only two levels: \"default\" and \"background\" level could be an acceptable compromise.\r\n\r\nBased on our previous agreement that having 8 levels of urgency would be sufficient, we chose 7 (the lowest) for background, and 3 (the middle of all levels excluding background) as the default.\r\n\r\nThe outcome is PR #1048.\r\n\r\nPS.

Not least because one half of the web (the client half) is largely restricted to working in JavaScript. It doesn't have to be stated as an explicit constraint in the spec, but it's been an underlying consideration. \r\n\r\nIf your serialisation function accepts a native JavaScript value, which is a reasonable assumption on today's web, it behooves us to provide you with a sanitisation/validation algorithm.\r\n\r\nWhat remains to be decided is where and how that algorithm is provided.

          "body": "For any given push, the correct priority is dependent on context. There is no perfect answer that will work optimally in all cases. In deciding a default, we can either (a) choose something we think is closest to correct for most cases, or (b) choose something that will minimize harm in most cases. I favor (b). It's very difficult to get (a) right for all of the reasons discussed in #1026.\r\n\r\nPush is often speculative: the server predicts that the client may need a resource, but the server doesn't know for sure (the resource might already be cached, or maybe it's not needed at all). \"Over pushing\" is a known problem and we have observed that push can be a footgun. Push is actually very hard to use well. @MikeBishop is concerned that assigning the minimum priority makes push useless unless the connection is otherwise idle, but that's exactly the point! If a push is speculative, as they often are in my experience, then idle times are the safest times to push.\r\n\r\nFurther, I would argue that no matter which priorities are chosen, push is very rarely useful on connections that are never idle. Suppose a web page has three files, HTML, CSS, and JPG, prioritized in that order. If the HTML is large enough (and can be generated quickly enough) so that the connection is never idle, then it's never beneficial to push the CSS or the JPG. The HTML is hogging the connection, so you might as well wait for the client to request each file explicitly. I can think of just two cases where push might be useful on a connection that is never idle:\r\n\r\n1. The server wants to interleave a pushed CSS file immediately after sending `<link rel=stylesheet>` from the HTML. The server will need custom logic for this anyway. The default priority is irrelevant.\r\n\r\n2. The client asks for a web page concurrently with another stream of requests. I don't have a good solution for this. It's difficult for the server to know what the correct priorities should be for a pushed resource relative to other concurrent requests (see #1026). I also believe this is an uncommon case -- the most popular motivating example for push involves a user who has never been to your site previously.\r\n\r\n@MikeBishop, I didn't grok what you meant by \"we can't rely on reprioritization of pushes\"?",

Thus, the push was pointless and we should have just waited for the client to make a request.\r\n- The default priority is high enough that the resource has already been encrypted and sent by the time reprioritization arrives.  Thus, the reprioritization was useless because the data has already been committed.\r\n- The default priority is high enough that the resource has already been encrypted and sent by the time reprioritization arrives, *and* the resource is large enough that it's still being streamed when the client's reprioritization arrives.

The server cannot predict which case it will end up in unless it precisely knows (a) how long it will take to generate the responses for A and B (to know if there will be idle time before sending the first byte of A); (b) the sizes of A and B (see Lucas' response); and (c) the effective BDP of the connection (possible to estimate in theory but this assumes the server push code has access to the current cwnd).\r\n\r\nIn practice, even well-meaning servers are going to use push in cases 1 and 3.

As we have discussed, one default does not fit all.\r\n\r\nWhen a server is the initiator of a pushed request, it would definitely know why it initiated that push. As it knows the reason, it would be possible to determine the correct urgency. When a server is obeying to an instruction from an upstream server (e.g., link rel=preload), the upstream server can provide a hint by using the priority header field in the pushed response, or make a guess based on other properties (e.g., type of the pushed resource, the fact that link rel=preload is being used, etc.).\r\n\r\nThese hints could work better than a hard-coded default in the spec. Assuming that is the case, my point is that we should encourage the use of such hints, and that maybe doing just that is enough.\r\n\r\n[1] Using \"can\" rather than \"SHOULD\", as we've reduced the guidance (see #1026).",

Is it also using it for `/b`? If the client believes the answer is no, while the server believes the answer is yes, secondary certificates introduces a [confused deputy problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem). Some examples to consider:\r\n\r\n* HTTP/2 cross-name pooling means one connection may service multiple origins. The client may choose to use a client certificate with some origins but not others.\r\n* The web platform makes both anonymous and credentialed requests (see CORS). Keeping those straight is critical to avoid CSRF attacks. For now, browsers do not pool them due to various problematic connection-level auth mechanisms in HTTP/1.1, but there is discussion on relaxing this for the vast majority of connections that don't use these. This puts a heavier dependency on protocols getting these kinds of details right.\r\n\r\nThis is especially important to make unambiguous because the original renegotiation-based hack for reactive client auth *did* rely on ambient authority. Once you renegotiated with a certificate, the unwritten interpretation was that all subsequent requests on this connection pick up the certificate. A server implementation may then be tempted to apply a similar logic to client certificates. The spec needs a MUST-level requirement not to do this, and make it clear that this is a server security vulnerability. Instead, client wishing to approximate the original renegotiation-based hack would send proactive `USE_CERTIFICATE` frames on subsequent credentialed requests.\r\n\r\nThis is especially important for HTTP/2, where there is both larger scope of pooling from cross-name bits and where multiplexing means we requests overlap temporally.",

Introduction\r\n\r\n> Applications that want to allow the server to optimize content delivery and user experience based on such capabilities have, historically, had to rely on passive identification (e.g., by matching User-Agent (Section 5.5.3 of [RFC7231]) header field against an established database of client signatures), used HTTP cookies [RFC6265] and URL parameters, or use some combination of these and similar mechanisms to enable ad hoc content negotiation.\r\n\r\n^ There's something weird going on with tense in this sentence.\r\n\r\n> Such techniques are expensive to setup and maintain, are not portable across both applications and servers, and make it hard to reason for both client and server about which data is required and is in use during the negotiation:\r\n\r\n\"Such techniques are expensive... are not portable... and make it hard...\" The third doesn't fit with the first two.\r\n\r\n* \"Client Hints mitigate the performance concerns...\" probably just \"Client Hints mitigate performance concerns...\" Likewise for \"the privacy concerns\" below.\r\n\r\n* \"This document defines the Client Hints infrastructure, a framework that enables servers to opt-in to specific proactive content negotiation features, which will enable them to adapt their content accordingly.\" --> \"This document defines Client Hints, a framework that enables servers to opt-in to specific proactive content negotiation features, adapting their content accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n* `[UA-CH]` as a normative reference probably isn't going to fly, given its status. Why is it normative?\r\n\r\n## 2.1. Sending Client Hints\r\n\r\n> Clients control which Client Hints are sent in requests, based on their default settings, user configuration, and server preferences.\r\n\r\nmaybe instead:\r\n\r\n> Clients choose what Client Hints to send in a request based on their default settings, user configuration, and server preferences expressed in `Accept-CH`.\r\n\r\n## 2.2. Server Processing of Client Hints\r\n\r\n> When doing so, and if the resource is cacheable, the server MUST also generate a Vary response header field (Section 7.1.4 of [RFC7231]) to indicate which hints can affect the selected response and whether the selected response is appropriate for a later request.\r\n\r\nBe aware that HTTP doesn't _require_ presence of `Vary` when proactive conneg is in use; if the response is truly uncacheable, it isn't necessary.\r\n\r\n> Further, depending on the hint used, the server can generate additional response header fields to convey related values to aid client processing.\r\n\r\nmaybe instead:\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, the server can generate additional response header fields (as specified by the hint or hints in use) that convey related values to aid client processing.\r\n\r\n## 3.1. The Accept-CH Response Header Field\r\n\r\n> The Accept-CH response header field or the equivalent HTML meta element with http-equiv attribute (Section 4.2.5.3 of [HTML]) indicate server support for particular hints indicated in its value.\r\n\r\ninstead:\r\n\r\n> The Accept-CH response header field indicates server support for the hints indicated in its value. This information can also be conveyed by the HTML meta element with the http-equip attribute (Section 4.2.5.3 of [HTML]).\r\n\r\nBTW, nothing is said about precedence between the two different mechanisms; separate issue?\r\n\r\n> When a client receives an HTTP response advertising support for provided list of Clients Hints, it SHOULD process it as origin ([RFC6454]) opt-in to receive Client Hint header fields advertised in the field-value, for subsequent same-origin requests.\r\n\r\nThe reference to 6454 is spurious, and it's pretty indirect. Perhaps:\r\n\r\n> When a client receives an HTTP response containing Accept-CH, it indicates that the origin wishes to receive the indicated request header fields for subsequent same-origin requests.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n* The opt-in MUST be delivered over a secure transport.\r\n* The opt-in SHOULD be persisted and bound to the origin to enable delivery\r\n   of Client Hints on subsequent requests to the server\u2019s origin, and MUST NOT\r\n  be persisted for an origin that isn\u2019t HTTPS.\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nIt's kind of weird to have this list just appear. Perhaps turn these into prose?\r\n\r\n> For example, based on the Accept-CH example above,\r\n\r\nPut \"For example\" above the example to introduce it.\r\n\r\n## 3.2.

The frame layout spends a byte for a single bit and is also inconsistent with the layout of other HTTP/3 frames, which makes things mildly more difficult for implementations.\r\n\r\nIan suggested we use different frame type codepoints to signal the target of the PRIORITY_UPDATE frame. There is already precendence for this and Kazuho noted that \r\n\r\n> In IETF 106, we had a similar discussion IIRC with regard to the QUIC datagram extension, and the WG seemed to favor allowing extensions to reserve a couple of adjacent frame types instead of using bits in the payload. Based on that, I am incliend to changing our design to use two frame types values.\r\n\r\nThe use of a frame for the initial priority is dependent on other issues such as the headers vs frame debate. If we needed a frame for that purpose, we probably want three frame types and the earliest code point with 3 spaces is 0xF, thus:\r\n\r\n* Initial Priority - 0xF - one and only one sent on request stream, contains priority-value\r\n*  Priority Update - 0x10 - reprioritize request stream, sent on control stream, contains ID and priority-value\r\n*    Priority Update - 0x11 - reprioritize push stream, sent on control stream, contains ID and priority-value\r\n\r\nIn order to make progress independent of the discussion on initial priority frame, we could shift the PRIORITY_UPDATE frame codepoint from 0xF to 0x10, but reserve 0xF for now.",

That is, given an existing secure cookie named 'a'\r\n        with a path of '/login', a non-secure cookie named 'a' could be\r\n        set for a path of '/' or '/foo', but not for a path of '/login'\r\n        or '/login/en'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the [algorithm](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-05#section-5.1.3) for `domain-matches` excludes IP addresses:\r\n```\r\n   A string domain-matches a given domain string if at least one of the\r\n   following conditions hold:\r\n\r\n   o  The domain string and the string are identical.  (Note that both\r\n      the domain string and the string will have been canonicalized to\r\n      lower case at this point.)\r\n\r\n   o  All of the following conditions hold:\r\n\r\n      *  The domain string is a suffix of the string.\r\n\r\n      *  The last character of the string that is not included in the\r\n         domain string is a %x2E (\".\") character.\r\n\r\n      *  The string is a host name (i.e., not an IP address).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus a cookie such as `A=B; Secure` that was set by `https://1.2.3.4` might be overwritten by an insecure cookie `A=C` that is set by `http://1.2.3.4`.\r\n\r\nThis seems unintentional and undesirable?",

This is somewhat related to https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/1033 which moved it into terminology, instead of Section 5.4.\r\n\r\nIn terms of \"rough consensus and running code\", in terms of widely deployed clients, the algorithm specified in the Public Suffix List is not consistently implemented, the algorithm itself is ambiguous for edge cases, and perhaps most importantly, none of the major implementations ship the same version of the Public Suffix List. Several implementations, including Google Chrome, further fork and modify that list to support their implementation needs.\r\n\r\nThus, it's really more of an informative dependency, similar to how 6265 captured this problem.

It is a shame the [reservations expressed in the W3C](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/467) relating to HTTP Client Hints do not appear to have surfaced in the debate or have not been considered worthy of a acknowledgement in the final draft.\r\n\r\nThe document does not recognise the wide adoption of HTTP User-Agent header value optimisations, the benefits they provide or the reliability of the techniques used. The justification for the existence of HTTP Client Hints is framed almost entirely from the singular position of privacy. The justification concerning improving performance is at best weak.\r\n\r\nThe document does not consider use cases that would be removed by adoption in practice, the impact to the open web of such removal, societal harms, or the competition issues that would result from web browser vendor implementations when considered alongside related proposals such as privacy budget.\r\n\r\nUses cases that will be removed include performance optimisation, the detection of fraud, and problem diagnosis as a few examples. \r\n\r\nOther use cases associated with knowledge of the user\u2019s agent are tacitly acknowledged by a [browser vendor that implements the X-Client-Data](https://9to5google.com/2020/02/06/google-chrome-x-client-data-tracking/) specifically for the purpose of receiving such information on first request. The implementation of X-Client-Data limits this information to services operated by the browser vendor, happens by default and without user consent or knowledge. For the same browser vendor to support a proposal that seeks to remove such information from others is disingenuous.\r\n\r\nWhere mitigations have been suggested they would in practice depend on a related proposal concerning privacy budget. Whoever controls the privacy budget and the default settings will therefore control the realisation of such use cases.\r\n\r\nWhere existing standards for interoperability are used to deliver vital content to people the provider of such services will need to modify their service to support HTTP Client Hints. This will be the case for millions of websites currently utilising accurate information contained in the User-Agent HTTP header value. This will consume untold developer effort running two parallel solutions and will take them away from more productive activity. The problem will be particularly acute in societies where mobile devices dominate access to information and will be a particular concern for people whose only method of accessing information is via a mobile device.\r\n\r\nAssuming it is not the role of this body to pick winners and losers I urge participants to consider a further review to engage a wide range of stakeholders to better understand fully the implications before progressing.",

The current state arose from concern that a malicious party could change the value of the `algorithm` parameter, potentially tricking the verifier into accepting a signature that would not have been verified under the actual parameter.\r\n\r\nPunting algorithm identification into `keyId` hurts interoperability, since we aren't defining the syntax or semantics of `keyId`.  It actually goes against that claim, as we are dictating that the signing algorithm must be specified by `keyId` or derivable from it.  It also renders the algorithm registry essentially useless.  Instead of this approach, we can protect against manipulation of the Signature header field by adding support for (and possibly mandating) including Signature metadata within the Signature Input.",

It won't work for a partial resource. So this is a subset of a subset. \r\n\r\nI'm more inclined to simply remove the mention of protecting against \"buggy compression\" and add some other prose. For example, in the Introduction where we say\r\n\r\n> However, there are cases where relying on this alone is insufficient. An HTTP-level integrity mechanism that operates independent of transfer can be used to detect programming errors and/or corruption of data at rest, be used across multiple hops in order to provide end-to-end integrity guarantees, aid fault diagnosis across hops and system boundaries, and can be used to validate integrity when reconstructing a resource fetched using different HTTP connections.\r\n\r\nWe can augment that to say `An HTTP-level integrity mechanism that operates independent of transfer can be used to detect programming errors and/or corruption of data in flight or at rest`.\r\n\r\nThen in the section `Digest for End-to-End Integrity` we might want to add some guidance about considerations for intermediaries that want to fiddle with content and/or content-coding. CDNs ability to modify content is one of their main value propositions - we see this where new compression schemes like brotli, or new formats like WebP. With other types of intermediary, I figure that they either care to respect end-to-end headers or they don't; there's not much to enactable write about here IMO.",

I think we dealt with the immediate issue, but it reminded me of a concern that's been in the back of my mind for a while -- that the forced-lowercase nature of these keys might be surprising and unwelcome, especially for developers who are encultured to use camelCase. \r\n\r\nThat was increased by seeing the Signatures presentation at the interim this week, where the proposal had a camelCased key, even though it was supposed to be a structured field.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious place that this would have effect is if we tried to backport `Set-Cookie` into a Structured Field, because it has a number of camelCase parameters. I had a chat with @mikewest who reassuringly pointed out that `Set-Cookie` parameters are case-insensitive, and they have tests to prove it. \r\n\r\nStill, I have a lingering concern here, and I wanted to clear it up before we publish the spec. I think the options are:\r\n\r\n1. Make editorial adjustments to make it super-clear that keys are case-forced to lowercase.\r\n\r\n2. Open up keys to allow uppercase characters, both on the wire and in the data model.\r\n\r\n3. Change the parsing algorithm to accept uppercase characters, but to force them to lowercase in the data model.\r\n\r\nIf we do (1), we can update the spec and ship it. The other options would require taking it to the mailing list, getting consensus and then updating the spec, tests and implementations.\r\n\r\nThoughts? I'm personally hovering between (1) and (3); I don't think (2) is good, in that it will make keys case-sensitive. I think the question, then, is how much appetite we have for change at this late stage.\r\n\r\n/cc @clelland @phluid61 @bsdphk ",

Stream ordering's role in how a server allocates resources is a bit buried. I think promoting it will help towards some of this discussion, so lets make a PR to do that. Personally, I see that as a property of the client-server connection with no need to recommend forward action. IMO whether the server has to fetch the file from a remote backend or just read it from a cache, there is no one-size-fits all answer.\r\n\r\nSo far our approach has been to adopt HTTP/2's general \"expressing priority is only a suggestion\" sentiment.  HTTP/2 does, while explaining the mechanics of trees, state how an implementation should allocate resources to them. We describe expectations for urgency and increment without normative language, generally leaning to making no recommendations. \r\n\r\n> What isn't clear from the draft is how other signals that were historically used for prioritization might be either used in combination with explicit signals or are rendered invalid by the priority signal being present. The obvious one is the h2 PRIORITY frame, which I assume has to be superseded.\r\n\r\nWe do spend some text explaining the more complicated case in H2 where SETTINGS is needed to disable tree-priorities, and how a client might send both signals until then. A client could expect either scheme to take effect until then, maybe we can spell that out.\r\n\r\n> For instance, can a server that would ordinarily use media type to prioritize requests still do so when the priority signals don't indicate clear preferences? Or does that server have to use only request order and explicit priority signals?\r\n\r\nSo https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-priority.html#merging does say something like \"the client could be wrong because the server might have additional information\". This is mainly to describe how to merge client and server extensible priority signals. But I think it holds true for something such as learning the content-type after receiving a request for \"accept: image/*\". I'm not sure how extensible priorities makes this situation any different than today.\r\n\r\nWithout formal definition of other signals, it seems hard to predict how an implementation might decide their order of importance. \r\nI wonder if this is issue is really identifying that \r\nI'm not so sure how to address \"other signals\" such as this because it doesn't seem covered by anything in HTTP/2, nor anywhere else really. We do provide text that explains how a proxy might respond to client and origin server extensible priority signals,\r\n\r\n",

It should not matter, for example, whether a particular library checks the validity period of the certificate before the signature. We know, empirically, that different libraries do very different things there: macOS vs Mozilla NSS vs Microsoft CryptoAPI each verify something like validity at different points within their verification algorithms.\r\n\r\nWe know it's deeply flawed to view there being \"the\" certificate chain for a server, because by definition, the chain is defined by the client's policy and set of trust anchors. As a consequence, we know that clients SHOULD implement certificate path building, to explore possible certificate chains, and we know that TLS 1.3 was explicitly updated to reflect those decades of running code and the emergent rough consensus that the `Certificate` message, beyond the first `Certificate`, is an attempt to aid/influence that.\r\n\r\n[RFC 4158](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4158) is a huge collection of different ways verifiers can process and examine errors, during forward path building and reverse verification, and notes that the trade-offs are heavily dependent upon client and use cases.\r\n\r\nWhile I can understand the appeal for providing 'informational' statuses, any suggestion beyond a level of `MAY` is probably too normative, and unsupported by the underlying specifications and best practices.",

Rearrange the `tls_*` errors so that they mirror the alerts above (leaving `tls_error`'s semantic as stated above); e.g., we'd have `tls_bad_certificate`, `tls_certificate_revoked`, `tls_certificate_unknown` and so forth\r\n\r\n2. Reduce everything into two errors, `tls_error_received` and `tls_error_generated` or similar.

For example, OpenSSL's reporting of errors is symptomatic of deeper flaws within its certificate verification; fixing those errors necessarily means some existing errors can't effectively be reported. This is covered at some length in [RFC 4158, Section 3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4158#section-3.2).\r\n\r\nUltimately, the set of errors that are relevant are, to an extent, subject to local policy: it's rare for certificate validators to think of errors in the ontology laid out by the TLS layer. Typically, a client just does a \"best guess\" (or just maps straight to `bad_certificate`) when trying to map to the TLS layer, in part so it doesn't disclose extra information. This is certainly true when you think about local policy, such as limits on validity or the requirement of associated metadata, potentially delivered over TLS, such as Certificate Transparency or OCSP Must-Staple.\r\n\r\nI think the core question is whether you expect the client and the proxy to be in the same management domain. If they aren't, and the ED seems to be oriented around this scenario (where server and proxy are likely same administrative domain, but proxy and client aren't), then it seems better served as an opaque diagnostic string. As RFC 4158 calls out, beyond the 'boolean' is really just an administrative/diagnostic capability, not something meant to be semantically rich, meaningful, or stable, and certainly not to allow next-hop policy decision making.",

If we are to suggest some type of logic, it has to work well across the board.\r\n\r\nI see at least three logics being discussed in this issue, that are to be used when the only hint given to the server is the extensible priority signals:\r\n1. divide the bandwidth between incremental and non-incremental responses based on their numbers (https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/1232#issuecomment-663724301)\r\n2. serve incremental responses first, then the non-incremental ones (https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/1232#issuecomment-663896182)\r\n3. first few bytes of incremental responses are given priority above non-incremental requessts, the remainders are given lower precedence (https://github.com/kazuho/draft-kazuho-httpbis-priority/issues/94#issuecomment-572032461, linked from https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/1232#issuecomment-665087636)\r\n\r\nAssuming that the goal of prioritization is to maximize the amount of meaningful output provided to the user at earlier moments, both (1) and (2) have downsides.\r\n\r\nThe problem with (1) is that it devotes some bandwidth to non-incremental responses when incremental responses are inflight. During the early stages of a connection, spending all available bandwidth on incremental responses is beneficial, because a server can assume that sending *some* portion of the response provides benefit to the user, if that response can be processed incrementally. To give an example, sending 10% of 5 incremental responses is better than sending 50% of a non-incremental response.\r\n\r\nIn contract, (2) suffers during the mid stages of a connection, because it significantly delays the transfer of non-incremental responses. As an example, when a non-incremental response carrying a JSON file and an incremental response carrying a progressive JPEG image is competing at the same urgency level, it is natural to assume that completing the transfer of the JSON file is more important than completing the transfer of the progressive JPEG image.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, my point is that the significant of sending a byte changes during the stages of a connection, or between the byte ranges of each response, if the response is incremental. That is why I tend to prefer (3), though the downside is that the logic is bit complex.\r\n\r\nAnd going back to my previous point, this whole discussion is about servers not using other knowledge that are likely to be available. It could well be the case that the server could make better decision, had it been given the knowledge that the application has.\r\n\r\nThat's why I tend to think that suggesting pitfalls (and the possibility of using other signals) is the answer here.",

However, it still needs a fallback algorithm when other sources of signaling are not available, for example if a new application sends a new image format that it does not understand. 10% is a good heuristic for JPG, but might not be applicable for, for example, streaming video files, as stalling at 10% would not be ideal.\r\n\r\nYour argument that \"10% of 5 incremental responses is better than sending 50% of a non-incremental response\" is completely valid. I'd even say that completing 99% of non-incremental response is equivalent to completing 0%. However, percentage is only part the story. Let's consider a situation where incremental response is 1MB and non-incremental response is 1KB, do we send 1KB after 10% of 1MB? Round-robin is a safe default. There might also be cases where we don't know the length ahead of time.\r\n\r\nThe question that matters to me is \"Is this algorithm worse than not supporting incremental-signaling at all?\" I'd be happy to support other algorithms if they can achieve this (not being worse).",

In practice, it can be approximated by the remaining amount of data to send for this resource.

The Priority HTTP Header Field\r\n**Revision**: \r\nThe Priority HTTP header field can appear in requests and responses. A client uses it to specify the priority of the **~~response~~ request**.  A server uses it to inform the client that the priority was overwritten.  An intermediary can use the Priority information from client requests and server responses to correct or amend the precedence to suit it  (see Section 6).\r\n\r\n**Section**: 5. Reprioritization\r\n**Revision**: \r\nAfter a client sends a request, it may be beneficial to change the priority of the **~~response~~ request**.  As an example, a web browser might issue a prefetch request for a JavaScript file with the urgency parameter of the Priority request header field set to \"u=7\" (background).  Then, when the user navigates to a page which references the new JavaScript file, while the prefetch is in progress, the browser would send a reprioritization frame with the priority field value set to \"u=0\".\r\n\r\nIn HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, after a request message is sent on a stream, the stream transitions to a state that prevents the client from sending additional frames on the stream.  Therefore, a client cannot reprioritize a **~~response~~ request** by using the Priority header field.\r\n\r\n**Section**: 6. Merging Client- and Server-Driven Parameters\r\n**Revision**:\r\nIt is not always the case that the client has the best understanding of how the HTTP **~~responses~~ requests** deserve to be prioritized. The server might have additional information that can be combined with the client's indicated priority in order to improve the prioritization of the **~~response~~ request**.\r\n...\r\nAn origin can use the Priority ~~response~~ header field to indicate its view on how an HTTP **~~response~~ request** should be prioritized.  \r\n...\r\n\r\n(Ok, I think it's not wise for me to give every occurrence. I hope you get the point)\r\n",

          "body": "Thanks for the quick feedback, @LPardue.  I am bit confused here.  Unless server attends to the request at priority, it can't even know the priority.  Indirectly response priority is driven by priority requested by client in request headers.  Of course, after server reads the request, we can then talk about whether it should respond fast.  If we really want that level of clarity then we should have two headers - request priority to make sure this request is queued ahead of other normal requests, response priority to queue the response ahead of existing normal responses.  Unless we have both in place, I am not sure if we can achieve the desired goal you have stated.  I think I may be missing something.  It would be great if you can expand a bit more on where my thinking is faltered.  Thanks again for your help.",

Most importantly, priority can be used to select\r\n>    streams for transmitting frames when there is limited capacity for\r\n>    sending.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this means HTTP/2 prioritization is concerned with managing how response bytes are sent in DATA frames on streams when multiplexing is taking place. Many HTTP/2 servers do consume priority signals (in HEADERS or PRIORITY frames) and adapt scheduling to these signals. Sadly, some servers do not.\r\n\r\nExtensible priorities is applicable to HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, so we need to select terminology that applies to both and accomodates the subtle differences when it comes to stream lifecycle.\r\n\r\nSince HTTP/2 prioritization was mainly focused on response multiplexing, we choose to use the term `response` to make the primary purpose of extensible priorities unambiguos.\r\n\r\nI have not heard anyone making a serious case for the need to control prioritizing request processing.

HTTP/2 specifies a maximum number of concurrently active streams, with streams which are either \"open\" or \"half-open\" counting toward the limit regardless of the ID.  I think what you're saying here is that you're modifying the definition of the limit to also include \"idle\" streams where priority information has been received.  However, you're not explicitly calling this out as a modification to the 7540 concurrency logic.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @MikeBishop in https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/pull/1167#discussion_r485149756_",

I recognize that failure to authenticate an alternative doesn't necessarily translate into a fatal error - the alternative is just not used.

      "body": "We've been circling an answer to this for a while.  The entire gamut of possible solutions is broad, and we haven't had much luck in reaching clarity here.\n\nOne the one end of the scale, it should be perfectly OK to send a request for an `http` origin over an authenticated TLS connection.  But we still have the (entirely legitimate) concern there is that some servers might get themselves confused by this.\n\nThe other end of the scale is the bells and whistles JSON stuff.  @mcmanus seemed OK with this based on his implementation experience, but it is a little complicated.  We found too many corner cases for me to be happy that it implementations wouldn't end up busted.  And now that we insist on authentication for the server, many of the features didn't make sense.\n\nWe've also considered an HTTP/2 setting.  That's appealing, but it does limit the applicability a little.\n## This proposal\n\nThis change aims more to the conservative end of that scale.  It keeps the `/.well-known/` resource, but simplifies it, reducing it to a flat list of origins.  The client only needs to acquire this from the authenticated server.\n\nThis doesn't defend against Alt-Svc attacks mounted by attackers with the ability to both send header fields and run an authenticated server, but we're in a very strange place if this is the sort of capabilities we ascribe to our attackers in our threat models.\n## Other changes\n\nI've explicitly added `http/1.1` here.  I believe that's reflective of consensus, but that part is easy to revert.\n\nThe text about client certificates is now clearer.\n",

So it is entirely up to each server implementation to use whatever format it wants. Also, it is not easy to find out the right way to implement a cookie-based Cache-Digest that would work on all web browsers, since the timing the browser consumes the cookies sent from the server depend on the timing of the response.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, the relatively low necessity and the technical difficulty makes me hesitate in pursuing the idea.",

A good end-to-end example would involve a client not aware of 103, a caching proxy aware of 103, a gateway (reverse proxy) sending some links in 103 roughly based on the URL and a server knowing perfectly what to prefetch. When the gateway receives the request, it would immediately emit a 103 with 2-3 links which are generic to the site (eg: css, logo) and passes the request to the server. The server knows based on the URL that some JS is needed as well and could send an extra 103 with 2-3 more links while processing. The proxy receiving these 103 can start to prefetch these objects and populate its cache, then send some push promises to the client with these objects.

Maybe there is something here that could be extracted, but this text doesn't do it.\r\n\r\nTake one sort of coincidental signal that the user might generate: they actively choose to send a password to the server.  This might be argued to indicate that further identification is acceptable to that user.  But passwords are - if the user follows good practices - origin-specific, and so the act of sending a password does not inherently create linkability.\r\n\r\nWhat you want to look for is a signal that the user is OK to link their activity here with activity elsewhere.

          "body": "@mcmanus Ah, that makes more sense, thanks!\r\n\r\nHowever, as of right now, the certificate cannot be rejected, because the only one is provided during initial TLS handshake, which means that if it's rejected, then there is no HTTP/2 connection to begin with.\r\n\r\nI agree that it gets a bit more complicated with the `CERTIFICATE` frame, especially because [the current draft, section 4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-bishop-httpbis-http2-additional-certs-04#section-4) allows implementations to not terminate the connection upon receiving invalid certificate, probably for the reasons mentioned by you.\r\n\r\nHowever, I feel a bit uncomfortable with a draft that doesn't even mention the malicious behavior, and doesn't define what clients should do in such cases.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, there are 2 cases to cover:\r\n\r\n1. Client connects to `https://evil.com` (certificate valid for `evil.com`), server sends `ORIGIN` frame for `https://bank.com`.\r\n\r\n2. Client connects to `https://evil.com` (certificate valid for `evil.com`), server sends `CERTIFICATE` frame with a certificate for `bank.com` signed by unknown CA, followed by an `ORIGIN` frame for `https://bank.com`.\r\n\r\nHow should clients behave in both of those cases? Neither is even mentioned in the current draft.\r\n\r\nFor the record, I'm fine if the consensus is different from what I suggested in this pull request, but I think that those cases should be mentioned and client behavior should be defined for them.",

          "body": "With coalescing, this still applies to the one certificate.  A connection might be good for `evil.com`, but not for `bank.com`, even when both appear in the same certificate.  That might be because `bank.com` has a pinning rule or Expect-CT or any one of a host of other reasons that a certificate might appear OK, but not be (the variety of reasons being why certificates are a nightmare of complexity).\r\n\r\nThis draft probably doesn't want to get into the details of the `CERTIFICATE` frame.  In your examples, an `ORIGIN` frame for origin that the server on this connection isn't authoritative for can - or maybe SHOULD - be ignored.  That ignoring can stop at the point that the server becomes authoritative for any reason (straw man example that isn't `CERTIFICATE`: the `notBefore` time might pass).",

I think that's well covered by the current spec; it doesn't imply an error, because the Origin Set is *never* used as the sole source of truth regarding what the conn is good for. If you can suggest clarifications to improve understanding of this, they're welcome, but I don't *think* doing so requires new spec language.\r\n\r\nWRT the server learning about whether a cert is good enough -- yes, but I think that's an issue for secondary certs. Probably.\r\n\r\nBTW, @PiotrSikora - we prefer issues to be raised separately, not as PRs; it makes them more discoverable. \r\n",

The client might decide that it wants to abort and not provide a\r\ncertificate or something, but most implementations don't really allow that sort\r\nof messing around.",

I still think I'd initialize this to the origin (including port) which prompted opening the connection, rather than the actual server port.

The fact means that it is not be easy for the client to determine the freshness of the entries that is going to be included in the digest.\r\n\r\nI am sympathetic to the idea, but I am afraid if the approach works well with the current mechanism of HTTP/2 caching. My understanding is that browsers that exist today only consume a pushed response when it fails to find a freshly cached response in its cache. Otherwise, the pushed response never lands in the browser cache. Unless we change the behavior of the browsers to respect the pushed response even if a freshly cached object already exists in its cache, there's a chance that servers would continually push responses that gets ignored by the client (due to the existence of a freshly cached response in the browser cache with the same URL).\r\n\r\n@yoavweiss Assuming that I correctly understand the motive of removing the distinction between a fresh digest and a stale digest, I would appreciate it if you could clarify your ideas on the problem.",

Entries are added to the digest when a resource is added to the cache and removed from the digest when a resource is removed.\r\n> \r\n> The reason is that I think the distinction doesn't make much sense, and maintaining it adds a lot of complexity, basically forcing browsers to recreate the digest for every connection at O(N) cost.\r\n\r\nThank you for the explanation. I now understand the intent better.\r\n\r\nI think that we need to consider two issues regarding the approach.\r\n\r\nFirst is the fact that a browser cache may contain more stale responses than fresh resources. Below are the numbers of cached objects found in my Firefox's cache (to be honest the date is from 2016, I haven't been using Firefox in recent weeks and therefore cannot provide up-to-date data).\r\n\r\n|host|fresh|stale|total\r\n|---|---:|---:|---:\r\n|*.facebook.com|790|1,483|2,273\r\n|*.google.com|373|630|1,003\r\n\r\nAs you can see, large scale websites tend to have more stale objects than fresh objects. In other words, including information of stale-cached objects increases the size of the digest roughly three times in this case. Since performance-sensitive resources (that we need to push) are likely to be stored fresh (since they are the most likely ones marked as immutable, or near-immutable), transmitting only the digest of freshly-cached responses makes sense.\r\n\r\nSecond is a configuration issue on the server side.\r\n\r\nOne strategy that can be employed by an H2 server (under the current draft) is to receive a digest of freshly cached resources only, compare the digest against the list of resources the browser should preload _by only using the URL_, and push the missing resources to the client. It is possible for a H2 server to perform the comparison without actually fetching the resource (from origin or from cache) since only the URL would be required for calculating the digest.\r\n\r\nThe proposal prevents such strategy from being deployed since it requires the ETag values to be always taken into consideration (should they be associated to the HTTP responses). In other words, servers would be required to load response headers of the resources to determine if it needs to be pushed, which could be a huge performance degradation on some deployments. \r\n\r\nFortunately, servers could avoid the issue by not including ETags for resources that it may push. I think such change on the server-side configuration would be possible, but we need to make sure if we are to take the path (of removing the fresh vs. stale distinction).\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure I understand your reference to the push cache vs. the HTTP cache in your comment. In light of my explanation, is there still an issue there in your view? \r\n\r\nLet me explain using an example.\r\n\r\nConsider the following case:\r\n* client has `https://example.com/style.css` with `ETag: 12345` and `Expires: Nov 30 2017`\r\n* on server-side, the resource has been updated to `ETag: 67890`\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a new request from the client, the server cannot determine if the client has style.css in its cache. Therefore, `style.css` would be pushed.\r\n\r\nThe client, when observing `link: </style.css>; rel=preload` (or equivalent `<link>` tag), tries to load the resource. Since the fresh resource exists within the browser cache, that would be used. The pushed version is ignored and gets discarded (*).\r\n\r\nThis would be repeated every time until the cached object either becomes stale or gets removed from the cache.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that the browser behavior (explained in *) is true for Firefox and also for Chrome. Am I wrong, or missing something?\r\n\r\n>> Do you have a working code that implements Cuckoo filters? I am curious to see it working.\r\n>\r\n> https://github.com/efficient/cuckoofilter is the reference implementation.\r\n\r\nThank you for the link. I will try to use it.\r\n\r\nOTOH, do you have some working code that can actually calculate the cache-digest value taking a list of URLs as an input (something like https://github.com/h2o/cache-digest.js)? I ask this because it would give us a better sense in how the actual size of the digest would be.\r\n\r\n>> The concept of SENDING_CACHE_DIGEST makes sense to me. Maybe we might want to adjust the codepoints and the naming in relation to ACCEPT_CACHE_DIGEST.\r\n> \r\n> Happy to change it. Do you have any specific changes in mind?\r\n\r\nOne way to proceed would be to split the discussion of `SENDING_CACHE_DIGEST` from Cuckoo filters into a separate issue or a PR. I do not have a strong opinion on the naming or the codepoints. What do you think? @mnot ",

          "body": "@yoavweiss Have you considered the approach using Cuckoo filter to generate GCS?\r\n\r\nI can understand the fact that you do not want to iterate through the browser cache when sending a cache digest. Per-host Cuckoo hash seems like a good solution to the issue.\r\n\r\nOTOH, as I described in my previous comment, it seems that sending the hash directly has several issues.\r\n\r\nThat is why I am wondering if it would be viable to generate GCS from the per-host Cuckoo filter that would be maintained within the browser.\r\n\r\nI can see three benefits in the approach, compared to sending the values of Cuckoo filter directly:\r\n* the size of the digest will be smaller\r\n* we can keep the distinction between fresh vs. cache. Sending digest of fresh resources only would end up in even smaller digests. Retaining the distinction lowers the bar to deploy cache-digests on the server side.\r\n    * note: you can store the time when the cached object becomes stale in the data associated to the Cuckoo filter entry (assuming that you would have associated data to handle resize, as we discussed in https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/268#issuecomment-261764848). That information can be used when builiding the GCS to determine if a particular object should go into a GCS of fresh resources or that of stale ones\r\n* less change to the browser push handling (no need to handle pushes of 304 or replace a freshly cached object when an object with the same URL is being pushed)\r\n\r\nIn case of `*.facebook.com` or `*.google.com` in the comment above, sending fresh-only digests using GCS would be about 1/3 the size of sending fresh & stale digests using Cuckoo filter.\r\n\r\nThe biggest cost of calculating GCS from Cuckoo hash would be the sort operation. But I think that the cost could be negligible compared to the ECDH operation that we would be doing for every connection, considering the fact that the number of entries that we would need to sort would be small (e.g., up to 1,000 entries of uint32_t), and the fact that sort algorithms faster than O(n log n) radix sort can be deployed (e.g. radix sort).\r\n\r\nWDYT?",

To me it seems it's worth giving a thought.\r\n\r\n> At the same time, it's not clear to me how that would enable a \"stale\" vs. \"fresh\" digests, or handling of improperly cached resources (fresh resources that were replaced on the server).\r\n\r\nUnder the approach proposed in this PR, structure that stores the per-host digest would look like below. `hashes` is required for resizing the filter (e.g., when doubling or halving `num_backets`).\r\n```\r\nuintFF_t fingerprints[num_backets]; // FF is the size of the fingerprint\r\nuint32_t hashes[num_backets];       // contains 32-bit hash value of each entry in `fingerprints`\r\n```\r\nWhat I am suggesting that you could change the structure to the following.\r\n```\r\nuintFF_t fingerprints[num_backets]; // FF is the size of the fingerprint\r\nstruct {\r\n  uint32_t hash;\r\n  time_t becomes_stale_at;\r\n} hashes_and_expire_times;\r\n```\r\n In addition to the hash value, each entry will contain the moment when the entry becomes stale. The moment can be calculated when the entry is added. For example, if the entry represents a HTTP response with a `cache-control: max-age=V`, `becomes_stale_at` can be calculated as `now + V`. If the entry represents an immutable HTTP response, then `becomes_stale_at` should be set to a very large value (e.g.. `INT64_MAX` assuming that underlying type of `time_t` is `int64_t`).\r\n\r\nWhen building a GCS digest, you would do the following:\r\n* step 1. prepare an empty list that would contain hashes of fresh responses\r\n* step 2. prepare an empty list that would contain hashes of stale responses\r\n* step 3. foreach entry in cuckoo_filter:\r\n  * step 3-1. check if the entry is fresh or not, by checking the value of `becomes_stale_at`\r\n  * step 3-2. if the entry is fresh, append `hash` of the entry to the list of the hashes of fresh responses\r\n  * step 3-3. otherwise, append `hash` of the entry to the list of the hashes of stale responses\r\n* step 4. sort the list of hashes of the fresh responses, encode as GCS, and send\r\n* step 5. sort the list of hashes of the stale responses, encode as GCS, and send\r\n\r\nYou can skip the operations related to stale objects (i.e. step 2, 3-3, 5) if the server is unwilling to receive stale digests.\r\n\r\nWhether the approach can be implemented depends on if a client can determine the moment a response becomes stale. I anticipate that it is possible to determine that when you register the entry to Cuckoo filters (which is when you receive the response from the server).",

      "body": "Simply swaps GCS with Cuckoo Filter.\r\n\r\nThe difference from #413 (which this PR is based upon) is that this PR retains the possibility of the client sending a digest of fresh resources without ETag values being included as part of the hash.\r\n\r\nThis was considered necessary so that an endpoint can determine if it needs to push a resource without the knowledge of the ETag value of the resource. For example, by URL being the only source of the hash function, a H2 proxy that just holds a list of preload URLs can determine which ones in the list needs to be pushed, _and then_ fetch them from origin servers to push them.",

Also, some implementations (e.g. JavaScript-based clients and servers) are not able to represent all values beyond 2^53. So similarly, if there's no expectation that a representation will ever exceed 2^53 bytes, values smaller than this limit should be used for the last-byte-pos in byte-range requests.`",

Then the `certificate_request_context` can be used to correlate CERTIFICATE with CERTIFICATE_REQUEST in the usual fashion.  That's how TLS does it - it sends Certificate without the certificate and omits the CertificateVerify message entirely if it doesn't want to authenticate.  (I just realized that I used CERTIFICATE, Certificate and certificate in the same paragraph to mean three different things, which is not at all confusing.)\r\n\r\nI just read exported authenticators again and I don't see that use case being addressed at all.  @grittygrease should be aware of that given that TLSEA is in WGLC.  I think that TLSEA needs to address that case one way or other.  If the intent is to have the using application manage rejection, then it needs to be clear where the responsibility lies.  However, I think that having authenticated rejection is superior and that should be expressly included in the draft with a description of how that is done.",

In the previous draft (i.e. where things were on-stream with the request and CertID was the only payload), you could omit the CertID and send a USE_CERTIFICATE with a length of zero, which meant \"I don't have / choose not to provide the requested certificate.  Deal.\"  (I think it actually said to assume the certificate provided via TLS, if any.)\r\n\r\nIf ExpAuth gives us an authenticated denial, I'd be fine using it.  But I'm also fine if it doesn't -- the point of ExpAuth is proving *possession* securely, and I think declining to provide an authenticator is sufficient for our purposes.  This isn't DNSsec where we want to authoritatively prove non-existence, we're just declining to supply (or, therefore, prove possession of) a certificate.",

If there is a TLS-terminating proxy intermediating the connection, the expected value will not match the received value, and the work of producing exported authenticators can be skipped.\r\n\r\nOne open question is around the use of early exporters.  I think this is probably something we want, so that servers can send additional certificates in their 0.5-RTT flight to 0-RTT clients.  However, should clients be required to supply a value derived from a regular exporter after the handshake finishes?  This is a minor pain in H2, but in HTTP/QUIC would require defining a separate frame type to carry the updated token.  The obvious value is that the server could still validate the token after forgetting the 0-RTT secret, but it seems like the server could as easily validate the setting early and remember the result even after discarding the secret.  Is there any additional security benefit to the client re-proving the connection is end-to-end after the handshake completes?",

UA's have a concept of user-initiated \"navigation\", but this doesn't extend to other potential clients \u2014 e.g. a native app using CH negotiation with a CDN should be able to define own logic for how to process the opt-in; FP doesn't apply for other clients.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to keep the text as is, otherwise we'll quickly find ourselves redefining HTML concepts, which we should instead defer to the HTML spec.\r\n\r\nWDYT?",

A CDN which requests certs on behalf of its customers can do the same thing, adding an extra domain owned by the CDN to each certificate.\r\n\r\nIn the more complex case, customers create certificates with RPD=\"coalesce.cdn.com\".  Now any customer's certificate can be coalesced onto any connection to the CDN *provided that* the CDN first presents a certificate for \"coalesce.cdn.com\" where RPD is either the primary certificate or \"*\".\r\n\r\n(One comment which has been raised in offline discussion:  Some origins might not want the CDN name human-readable in the certificate.  CDNs could address this by using a less-branded domain, but we could also address this in the extension design by using hashes of domain names if desired.)",

It's either a total wildcard (\"Use with anything\") or a specific name.  That specific name could be matched by a wildcard in the primary certificate, of course.\r\n- Requires CAs to verify the presence of a CAA record before issuing, so the issue of a misissued certificate is somewhat better constrained.",

MUST do when a server violates one of its MUSTs.\r\n* I removed the (incorrect) `token / \"/\" / \"?\" / \"\\\" / \"[\" / \"]\" / \":\" / \"@\" / \"(\" / \")\"` definition of available-value in favor of allowing arbitrary [Structured Header strings](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure.html#string). It wasn't clear what excluding characters like `{` was gaining us, and the restriction would have required extra words when parsing the headers.\r\n* I removed {{gen-variant-key}} entirely and had Compute Possible Keys return a list of lists that could be directly compared against the Structured Header parse of `Variant-Key`. It would be difficult to keep the old behavior of returning a list of strings without re-adding some restriction on an available-value, for example by requiring that they don't contain spaces.\r\n* I simplified Compute Possible Keys a bit.",

It's mandatory to check for overflows during the parsing, like we do here for example : http://git.haproxy.org/?p=haproxy.git;a=blob;f=src/h1.c;hb=HEAD#l52\r\nMany integer parsers will reliably provide the information about the fact that an overflow was detected, but when it comes to floats it might not necessarily be the case (since very large numbers can still fit in a float), however the check against bounds is expected to work.\r\n\r\nThis means that we should mandate the use of a reliable parser known for detecting overflows, AND then check for the output number to fall within our bounds.\r\n\r\nWe should also warn against the risk of using generic parsers which as a byproduct of checking for errors, also happen to support base prefixes like \"0x\", or float parsers supporting exponents like \"1e32\" or special values like \"inf\", \"-inf\", \"nan\", all of which defeat length checks.\r\n",

Even strtol() with no forced base is dangerous, believed to return an error if something doesn't match, except that \"0x12\" is automatically converted.\r\n\r\nThus the warning I'm proposing is that many conversion functions provided by libraries or languages are more tolerant than the spec and allow values or ranges which can introduce vulnerabilities.",

Among other\r\nproblems, as this document notes in section 1.2.3, there is no defined\r\nway to correlate application-visible renegotiation events\r\n(CertificateRequest) with HTTP/2 requests. In essence, the prohibition\r\nis a reflection of TLS+renegotiation being the wrong API shape for\r\nHTTP/2 (and most protocols).\r\n\r\nTLS 1.3 removed renegotiation, but added post-handshake client\r\nauthentication to replace some of renegotiation's use cases. This\r\nretains the problems above. However, with the feature renamed,\r\nRFC7540's prohibition no longer applies and we're stuck with an\r\nincompatibility between RFC8446 and RFC7540.\r\n\r\nPost-handshake authentication is optional in TLS 1.3 and advertised with\r\nan extension, but this is not sufficient. Most HTTP/2 clients are also\r\nHTTP/1.1 clients and TLS parameters are negotiated in parallel. An\r\nHTTP/1.1+HTTP/2 client that advertises the extension for HTTP/1.1 (see\r\nsection 1.2.2 of this document) also advertises it for HTTP/2.\r\n\r\nBy a strict composition of the existing specification text,\r\nHTTP/2-capable clients cannot offer post-handshake authentication to\r\nHTTP/1.1 servers.\r\n\r\nIn reality, existing HTTP/2 servers won't use this mechanism because no\r\none has defined a request correlation. Thus we can fix all this by\r\nclarifying that TLS 1.3 post-handshake auth is forbidden whether or not\r\nthe client offered it.\r\n\r\nIf some future use case comes up, it can define an overriding extension\r\nwith a correlation mechanism. It would already need to do so, because\r\nexisting clients wouldn't know about the correlation. This is unlikely\r\nto happen anyway because this document *is* that use case, and it\r\nalready defines a separate mechanism.",

It's worth mentioning that post-handshake auth doesn't fix HTTP/2's problems with renegotiation in 1.2.3; that's currently a gap.  I don't think filling that gap with a change to HTTP/2 all-up is appropriate.\r\n\r\nI agree, a separate RFC for this text seems overkill.  It's certainly not an erratum, as the mechanism in question didn't exist at the time of 7540. But I don't think this document is the right home and I don't know of another in-progress document that would be either.  So my inclination would still be a super-short RFC.\r\n\r\nI suspect we could sidestep making a blocking reference pretty easily.  Your proposed text focuses on client behavior when negotiating which protocol to use, which the document currently doesn't address.  If it publishes first, it could crib some introductory content from here and we'll add an informative reference to it here (close the gap above, \"...and it is therefore prohibited by XXXX.\"); if later, it can point to this doc for a description of the problem it's solving and be even shorter.",

I'd rather it be codified in a spec, as this is a general problem, than for us to just make up a rule ad-hoc.\r\n\r\n(This is why I wanted post-handshake auth to be conditioned on an application profile.

In some cases this can create a security issue, e.g. if an application uses the presence of such a header to identify trusted requests -- this approach is a relatively common CSRF protection because the server can be sure that requests with a custom header were sent same-origin, or the server had opted into them in response to a CORS preflight.\r\n\r\nI don't feel very strongly about this particular case, but in general I'm worried about browsers sending new unprefixed headers by default for this reason.",

Rather than insisting on a one-by-one exception, a systemic exception for client hints would be preferable.\r\n\r\nThe way that this draft models CH header fields is that the site collects the information and injects the header field in every request as it leaves for the server (as if by service worker fetch interception).  The browser is just helping out.  If we are able to adhere to that model, then allowing insertion is different than header fields like `User-Agent` or `Origin` or other security-critical fields.\r\n\r\nIf this model is correct, then it doesn't make sense for these to be forbidden or for them to require special processing for exemption.  Note that this changes how the information needs to be generated (it can't access privileged information; that's already in this doc), and it means that these are treated like any other header field.\r\n\r\nAs for concerns about interaction with ambient authority that a server might associate with the request, I think that I will point back at the bit where the server explicitly asked for the hint to be provided.  I concede that cross-resource concerns might be a problem (resource A asks, resource B is unprepared), but the set of fields will be small, carefully groomed by browser makers, mostly prefixed with `CH-`, and carrying information that is not obviously useful in security-critical decisions.

I believe delivering hints with a `Sec-` prefix would indeed avoid the class of problems discussed above; is there a specific issue that you're still worried about in this case?\r\n\r\n\r\n",

User agents, such as web browsers, ensure such prefixed headers may only be emitted by the browser, and application content, such as scripts, are forbidden from emitting such headers {{FETCH}}. This provides assurance that, when transmitted by user agents, that both the type and format of data communicated in such request headers are enforced by the user agent.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, specifications and features relying on Client Hints are RECOMMENDED to include the \"CH-\" in the header name, for example, in the form `Sec-CH-Foo` for a hypothetical Client Hint `Foo`. Client Hints provide additional information about a user agent [1] that previously may only have been accessible to scripts or content [2], and not necessarily transmitted in requests. Servers that wish to minimize the data collected in intermediate steps may wish to filter out all unrecognized or unprocessed \"CH-\" values from its records or intermediate steps, and a consistent use of \"CH-\" helps facilitate filtering new and unrecognized Client Hint Values.\r\n**END**\r\n\r\n[1] I'm not sure if this is strictly about UAs?\r\n[2] I'm not entirely happy with that wording, but *shrug*\r\n\r\nHowever, from our IETF 105 conversation, @mnot aptly pointed out that such concerns arguably apply to any/all new headers, and so perhaps the 'CH-' infix may be entirely unnecessary, because it's a generalized problem. The language I offer above attempts to provide explanation/justification for the RECOMMENDation, but I could also see with doing away with 'CH-' entirely.",

So you get the value of the \"Foo\" header field mixed in with the \"foo\" query parameter.  That motivates **a** prefix, but it doesn't motivate the \"Sec-\" one.\r\n\r\nI hadn't heard that reason properly before.  It took me a while to internalize it.\r\n\r\nAnd then it didn't make sense.  The more I think about this, the more that I think that the \"CH-\" prefix is useful, but the \"Sec-\" one isn't.  On the contrary, I see value in giving script the ability to query for different content using these header fields.  For one, it might allow an app that is preparing for going offline in the browser the ability to request content based on anticipated rather than current needs.\r\n\r\nFor example, assuming for a moment that I thought `Save-Data` was useful (it's not), then the content could request the lightweight content that this targets, to avoid expending resources on the fetch or storage.  At that point, I don't have to have an opinion on `Save-Data` from the browser perspective, it might as well be yet another proprietary header field.",

The core of it is to reuse \"Parsing/Serializing a List\"'s logic by passing in \"Inner\" or \"Outer\". I'm not sure if this makes things more or less complex to follow. :)\r\n\r\nTwo stylistic questions:\r\n\r\n1.  Some places in the text use the \"result of [ALGORITHM]\". Others the \"result of applying [ALGORITHM]\", others \"running [ALGORITHM]\". Some pass in arguments, others leave them inferred. What would you like this patch to do? :)\r\n\r\n2.  COMMA is spelled out in algorithms, while \";\" is not (nor are \"-\", \"_\", \"-\", etc). There's probably a reason for this, but I don't understand it. Is it an ABNF grammar thing? Is COMMA actually a set of characters?\r\n\r\nAnd, as noted in the issue, these algorithm rely on quite a bit of magical knowledge of type expectations. That makes me uncomfortable as someone who might someday need to write a parser in Chromium...",

(I'm a little torn on whether HTTPSSVC should actually align with the Alt-Svc HTTP header. They do very similar things, but the authentication is very different.)\r\n\r\nWhen the client fetches HTTPSSVC from DNS, there is no authentication from the actual origin server. Even if using DoH, DoH only authenticates the resolver. The resolver could still inject things. (I'm ignoring DNSSEC here as that's not really a thing on the web today.)\r\n\r\nOf the features in HTTPSSVC right now, alias records and remote Alt-Svc are just funny CNAMEs. The resolver can deny you access to the server, up to the record's TTL, but that is already true. Injecting a bad QUIC advertisement is similar. Injecting an invalid ESNI key can likewise just deny access to the server or cause the client to encrypt the SNI badly. The DNS resolver, already learns the SNI, so that's consistent. (It would not be okay to, e.g., just use the ESNI key as-is to replace the TLS certificate because of this.)\r\n\r\nClient hints affects the HTTP requests we'd actually send over TLS, so that has different properties to think through.",

A server could support ADLER32 without that support impacting on cryptographic data integrity provided that server also supports a cryptographically secure hash; e.g., SHA-512.  Clients that wish to protect against malicious actor changes would use the SHA-512 hash and not request (or ignore) the ADLER32 value.  Therefore, I would suggest that, for the server, the document says a server MAY implement ADLER32.\r\n\r\nI think it is perfectly reasonable for the document to say the client SHOULD NOT use ADLER32, for the reasons stated.\r\n\r\nThat said, I can't decide if this distinction is really helpful, so I defer to your judgement, here.",

We are proposing the implementation of what we call a privacy budget. With a privacy budget, websites can call APIs until those calls have revealed enough information to narrow a user down to a group sufficiently large enough to maintain anonymity. After that, any further attempts to call APIs that would reveal information will cause the browser to intervene and block further calls.\r\n\r\nWithout normatively requiring such an implementation, it's attempting to highlight that user agents that have policies or tracking around equivalent APIs should also consider the emissions of client hints in that context.",

This all rides on having strong coupling between information access controls and the network query.  That is, it is assumed that sites that can access information are also able to send themselves that information and that having those two events conjoined in the browser is equivalent to that in every way.  As long as that is true - it's an assumption here that probably needs to be more clearly articulated - then this is OK.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that this list isn't all that needs to be considered when deciding whether it is appropriate to expose information as a client hint.

I think it's fine to say that 7 should be reserved for background downloads and it's fine to say that the main HTML should use level X, for some X, but I'm not sure why X=3 was chosen. It seems like this could work just as well with X=0 or X=1.\r\n\r\nNote that Chrome (and WebKit/Safari?) use 6 priority levels currently. With X = 3, there are 5 levels available which means that Chrome (and WebKit/Safari?) need to fold two levels into one. This is not a dealbreaker but IMO there should at least be a good reason why levels 0-2 need to be reserved for the server when clients have a demonstrated use for 6 of 8 levels. Ideally someone from Firefox (and Safari) should chime in as well.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth mentioning that this pull request doesn't have enough information to do everything that [this comment](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/1026#issuecomment-582776695) wants to do. For example: \"a server might demote them to the same level as asynchronously fetched JavaScript files, or to somewhere even below, but above background downloads.\" It's not possible to demote to the same level as async JS, because the level of async JS is not specified. Also, it's not trivial to set a priority \"above background downloads\" because the pull request merely states that level 7 is reserved for background downloads, not anything about level 6 (perhaps some client has many background downloads and wants to partition those into two levels). I wouldn't change this pull request though -- this pull request seems like the right level of detail.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, this looks good but I would suggest changing the level of mainframe requests to 0 or 1.",

If this matches the priority the client would have reprioritized to (because it is more important) you save the client from sending a pointless reprioritization. ",

I hadn't thought about that, but the new design does not forbid a client from using level(s) above 7 for background tasks too. That said, I agree with you that we do not need to be more strict.\r\n\r\nRegarding the default level, based on your comments, I am going to change it to 1. I think it would be a good idea to provide one level above default, considering the fact that Firefox prioritizes JavaScript and CSS files above HTML. But I do not think we need more than one.\r\n\r\nThen, if people prefer having symmetry (i.e. having same number of urgency levels above and below the default), we can consider increasing the number of levels to 10 (or maybe 12) so that there would be sufficient number of levels below the default.",

If the browser correctly uses that.\r\n\r\nFor point 1, while there would likely be no bufferbloat in HTTP/3, there will be in HTTP/2. For point 2, the discussion is ongoing in #1021, and I am not sure if we can be certain that browsers would reprioritize pushed assets even in case of it being specified.\r\n\r\nConsidering these aspects, I tend to think that the correct thing for a server to do by default would be prioritize the pushed response right after the response that initiated the push.

This is because URLs of pushed responses and the HTML would reach clients before the pushed resources do.

It's easy to hurt performance by over-pushing, such as by pushing low priority resources or cached resources. A level 7 default reduces the potential impact of this footgun. As @LPardue said, this is just a default; the server can always do something different when it believes it knows better.\r\n\r\n> Clients would be possible to cancel the pushed resources when or before when it discovers\r\n\r\nIt's difficult for the client to know whether or not they should cancel a pushed resource.

          "body": "Thanks for the feedback. I think the big question here is about the order of presentation of information. Personally, having come back to read the spec back-to-front with fresh eyes, starting with Resource Representation really didn't help to inform me what Digest Header was. I can imagine I am not alone in this and that it might cause kind individuals who review this document to bounce off. \r\n\r\nThe Resource Representation and Digest Algorithm Values sections contain useful content, especially the text in early paragraphs, but the rest of the text boils down to lists of stuff with little normative text. Draft 01 spends 10 pages before it introduces the Digest header - compare that to RFC 3230 which in its entirety is only 10 pages. This is weird given that one premise for adopting the update update is that we can rely on core draft definitions now and things should be simpler.\r\n\r\nLooking at contemporary drafts, they tend to bubble up the \"meat\" of the specification early on. So with the restructure, what I was trying to do is to say \"Here's a way to carry an integrity checksum, calculating that checksum is dependent on a bunch on non-obvious stuff; you should read the background and check out the examples later in the document.\".\r\n\r\nRFC 3230 was written in a different era and we shouldn't follow its structure too much. So while it is logical to present Want-digest first, in practice I'm not convinced that many people care about it\r\n",

A reference to RFC7231 remains but is demoted to informative.\r\n\r\nThe change converts `Digest` and `Want-Digest` into `fields` meaning they can appear in header or trailer field sections. As noted there is a clear case for Digest trailers, there seems no reason to restrict Want-Digest to request header fields but I can be easily persuaded.\r\n\r\nRemaining references to `header fields` relate to externally defined headers that are coined in draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics.\r\n\r\nFinally, the IANA registry handling is also updated.",

Closes https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/1119\r\n    by removing OWS from the spec, as user agents generally follow\r\n    the \"SHOULD\" in the current text to limit themselves to a single\r\n    SP rather than serializing with OWS. It's reasonable to lock that\r\n    in, and it also happens to match all the `Cookie:` header tests\r\n    we have.\r\n\r\nThanks to both @reschke and @bakulf for paying attention to this.",

There are relatively few of these possible -- indicating more certificates to use than were requested, or more than one unsolicited certificate; sending CERTIFICATE_NEEDED to a peer that didn't indicate support for this extension.\r\n- The **authenticator is corrupt**.  This might indicate a problem with the TLS connection.\r\n- The **certificate isn't acceptable**.  There are lots of reasons this might happen.\r\n\r\nThe first two should be at least stream and possibly connection errors.  The latter should be handled at the HTTP layer, but previously had error codes defined for them.  This PR removes several error codes and recommends handling at the HTTP layer if the certificate isn't accepted.",

For good reasons.\r\n\r\nConsider the case of an H3 client sending a HTTP request with a Priority header field, then changing its mind and sending a PRIORITY_UPDATE frame. As H3 does not guarantee delivery order across streams, the server might receive the frame before the header. I'd assume that we'd want servers to apply the value carried by the frame. Even when the protocol is H2, I am not sure if all the H2 stacks have the guarantee that the information across multiple streams are sent in the order they are issued, or that they are provided to the application in the order they are received.",

For example, `http_protocol_error` doesn't mention `details`, yet you use so as part of the illustrative example.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, you *could* split this into two: `tls_protocol_error` and `tls_certificate_error`. The former indicates something went wrong with the TLS protocol (which could include both handshake and ongoing use), while the latter indicates an error while verifying the certificate (for which `details` is useful). Similar to `http_protocol_error`, it serves as both the fallback (e.g. if the proxy doesn't expose certificate errors distinct from TLS errors and treats them just as handshake errors) and as a distinct state (errors sending that may not result in a peer alert - e.g. if it receives a malformed message *from* the peer)",

In order to land this change I think we need to solve that editorial problem. Part of what would help that is to state our algorithm editorial rules in the terminology.",

It incorporates the suggestions on issue #1260 mixed\r\nin with some text we already had.\r\n\r\nThere is still a question about how an implementation can limit its buffering commitments, which depends on the servers applications ability to access stream information. This might no be exposed by a QUIC library for instance. I suggest we punt on that unless there is something easy we can capture now.\r\n\r\nCloses #1260 ",
